    r_loss = mse_loss(y_true, y_pred)
    kl_loss = kl_loss(mean, log_var)
    return  r_loss + kl_loss

and I could comment out the k1_loss in the vae_loss function to get it to run. So I am thinking something is wrong with the function, but I am admittingly niave in this space.

Oh well I'm guess the global install that succeeded is good for C++ development if I ever need to.  One thing I know is that the C++ documentation was better than Python's before version 4 when I took a computational photography class at school.  Anyways I'm googling how to change the python for opencv to point to my miniconda python rather than the WSL2 system Python as it is now but if you know how to do this, please let me know.  I'm not even sure if this a solution.  I'm also not sure if pip installing opencv-python in each conda env is going be CUDA enabled.nn

Have you tried following the blog referenced above and have encountered problems? Which?

What environment (in WSL2) do you look for (like you want or have to build OpenCV from source due to configs, changes, patches; using OpenCV under Python3 as well as under C++)??

Because of your method does not fit the paraments, so it can not use that method 'cv::estimateAffinePartial2D'

Here are two method to solve the problem.

Firstly, you can use cv2.estimateAffinePartial2D() to instead the old method.
Secondly, you can degrade your OpenCV version.

In my view, i actually adverse your to solve the problem with method1.

So, My model was trained in Google Colab with the Roboflow settings. (https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1gDZ2xcTOgR39tGGs-EZ6i3RTs16wmzZQ) I have one Object class to detect (humans). Neural Network size is changed to 256x256 (before training so i didnt just change it afterwards).  When i trained my Model for the Darknet format (Yolov4, Yolov4-tiny) I could successfully load it into Opencv and use it (Different way of getting the Detection boxes etc) so the model itself or the lack of labeled data cant really be the issue. My Dataset has 15k labeled images. The Trained Yolov5s model was also tested in detect.py from (https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5).

**CONVERSION:**
https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5 export.py. 
Command i used:
```
python export.py --weights model.pt --img 256 256 --include onnx
python export.py --weights model.pt --img 256 256 --include onnx --simplify
```
Both commands successfully converted the PyTorch model to ONNX and both gave me the same Output in VS22


**INFERENCE CODE:**
https://github.com/spmallick/learnopencv/blob/master/Object-Detection-using-YOLOv5-and-OpenCV-DNN-in-CPP-and-Python/yolov5.cpp 
I used the Example : ""Object-Detection-using-YOLOv5-and-OpenCV-DNN-in-CPP-and-Python"" and there i used the C++ Code. 
```
const float INPUT_WIDTH = 256;
const float INPUT_HEIGHT = 256;
```
i loaded my model (yolov5s) and the images i give the neural network are all 256x256 like the neural network input size. blob size is also 256x256. Color format is BGR but i also tried RGB color Format but same issues.

1112868358,"Can you provide more details about your model, please? You are based on a YoloV5s model, but retrained it?
Can you describe your code, please?
Do you use the example ""Object-Detection-using-YOLOv5-and-OpenCV-DNN-in-CPP-and-Python"", or another application?
Have you done any changes or are you using your own application?

Depending on the used code and which APIs are called the input resolution will be upscaled or downscaled to the NN's expected resolution.
If you provide an input picture of 256x256 (and three color-channels) then - depending on which code is used, which APIs are called - it will be upscaled to 640x640 (and three color-channels).
It's important to know whether the model expects the color-channel in RGB or BGR order.

Can you maybe share your model and your code and example input files - and then show the output you get and explain, what you think is wrong?",provide model please based model describe code please use example another application done application depending used code input resolution resolution provide input picture three depending code used three important know whether model order maybe share model code example input show output get explain think wrong,issue,positive,negative,neutral,neutral,negative,negative
1112863575,But it works in the detect.py inference file from yolov5 repo. I tested also simplifying the onnx export with onnx-simplifier but that also didn’t help. That’s why I’m sure it’s Opencv related. On yolov5 repo I also saw people having problems loading an exported model (onnx) into Opencv but they just said that they don’t provide any examples to load it in Opencv dnn framework,work inference file tested also export also help sure related also saw people loading model said provide load framework,issue,positive,positive,positive,positive,positive,positive

I cloned opencv and opencv_contrib from the branch ""4.5.5"", built it.

1086942355,"Hi,

OK, I followed [https://learnopencv.com/automatic-license-plate-recognition-using-deep-learning/?ck_subscriber_id=452195442](url)

And decided to try training.
Initial steps are fine.

Then, under Dataset, after ""import math"" three more imports are needed.
```
import math
import os
import matplotlib.image as image 
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
```

Make sure the cdw is darknet
`%cd darknet`
Now the images show nice in the plt.

Under ""Training"" you skipped the location for data.names.
Also the contents are wrong:
# place in darknet/data
```
classes = 1
train = ./darknet/data/obj/train.txt
valid = ./darknet/data/obj/test.txt
names = /content/gdrive/MyDrive/yolov4-darknet/darknet/data/obj.names
backup = ./checkpoint
```
# Change to:
```
classes = 1
train = ./data/obj/train.txt
valid = ./data/obj/test.txt
names = ./data/obj.names
backup = ./checkpoint
```
 You had remains of colab and the path should not have ""darknet"" in it.

# correct train.txt
the downloaded train.txt is for colab and has oto be updated from:
/content/gdrive/My Drive/yolov4-darknet/darknet/data/obj/train/3fe012d7a03f9927.jpg
to:
./data/obj/train/3fe012d7a03f9927.jpg

# checkdir
You fogot to mention that ""checkdir"" should be created under darknet
`!mkdir checkpoint`

# yolo4.conv.137
You forgot to mention that yolov4.conv.137 should be under ./darknet

Now the traing command works:
`!./darknet detector train data/obj.data cfg/yolov4-obj.cfg yolov4.conv.137 -dont_show -map`

It executed fine and then gave the message below: "" Error: cuDNN isn&apos;t found FWD algo for convolution""

> Unlike findHomography and estimateRigidTransform, the function findTransformECC implements an area-based alignment that builds on intensity similarities. In essence, the function updates the initial transformation that roughly aligns the images. If this information is missing, the identity warp (unity matrix) is used as an initialization. Note that if images undergo strong displacements/rotations, an initial transformation that roughly aligns the images is necessary (e.g., a simple euclidean/similarity transform that allows for the images showing the same image content approximately). Use inverse warping in the second image to take an image close to the first one, i.e. use the flag WARP_INVERSE_MAP with warpAffine or warpPerspective. See also the OpenCV sample image_alignment.cpp that demonstrates the use of the function. **_Note that the function throws an exception if algorithm does not converges._**

Hi everybody,

I am so sorry for this question. Does anyone try with virtual environment Anaconda, I did install a virtual environment with python 3.5 and openCV 3.4.2 but there is a problem that certain function is not implemented, something basic like cv.imshow(winName, frame) and cv.waitKey(3000).

Any idea is welcome

* replaced ```round()``` to ```int()``` for sizes

Here is the patch [1.txt](https://github.com/spmallick/learnopencv/files/3647620/1.txt)
Best wishes :)

Subject: Re: [spmallick/learnopencv] openimages downloader error (#250)


I think the issue is that rm and mkdir are a linux commands. We need the del /f/s and cd commands for Windows instead.
subprocess.run(['del', '/f/s', run_mode],shell=True)
subprocess.run(['cd', run_mode],shell=True)

Not sure yet what to do about command.split().

Note: This library will be deprecated and removed in a future NDK release. Beginning with NDK r16, you should use libc++ instead.

What i mean is that OpenCV use the `gnustl_shared` standard library, so if you don't use this library in your android project, the compiler will complain with every methods that has string or vector as argument.

If you use CMake you can add this snippet in your build.gradle under `android->defaultConfig`:
```java
externalNativeBuild {
            cmake {
                cppFlags ""-std=c++11 -fexceptions""
                abiFilters 'x86', 'x86_64', 'armeabi', 'armeabi-v7a', 'arm64-v8a'  //keep only supported arch by your app
                arguments ""-DANDROID_PLATFORM=android-15"",  // change with your min api level
                        ""-DANDROID_TOOLCHAIN=clang"",

                        ""-DANDROID_CPP_FEATURES=rtti exceptions""
            }
        }
