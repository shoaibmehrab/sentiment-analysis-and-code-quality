517759925,"@Titousensei thanks! So with the `IntentSlotTask` example working for me, here's my original question. Say, I want to generate this config but override some of the parameters right away via the `options` argument, e.g.:

```bash
pytext gen-default-config task.IntentSlotTask.data.Data.batcher.PoolingBatcher.eval_batch_size=1 IntentSlotTask
```

for which I get:
```bash

517427986,"This article you linked is using an older version of PyText, probably v0.1.0. The new version of PyText v0.2.0 will try and load this older version of a config and convert it to the latest version, but his is not always possible to do automatically, and it seems to be the case here.

As you suggest, it's better to start fresh from a new config with the latest version. `JointTextTask` is not supported anymore and was renamed `JointTextTask_Deprecated`. The new version is called `IntentSlotTask`. You can get a config by running the command:

  `pytext gen-default-config IntentSlotTask > my_config.json`

You will need to edit the file `my_config.json` to fill in the `field_names` (previously called `columns_to_read`), `train_filename` (and other filenames, previously called `train_path`), `pretrained_embeddings_path`, and maybe others.

- as you observed, issue 1 is already solved.
- for issue 2, BrokenPipeError is often caused by truncated files. Handling it as an exception might hide the fact that your files are corrupted. Could you verify that yours are complete? Mine have 4978 rows for train and 893 for test.
- how did you resolve issue 3? --include my_classifier tells PyText to look into the directory my_classifier/ for your custom python files. Knowing the problem you had and how you resolved it will help me print a better error message.
- issue 4 is a known problem and the updated tutorial should be published soon. In the mean time, you just need to revert the two arguments:

480736064,"Hi all,
it seems that I have the same question as @habout632.

- When I train the model:
```bash
pytext train < textcnn_with_common_crawl_w2v.json
```

It takes long time loading embedding (the file is 5.3G, so it should take long time), and prints:
```
load pretrained embeddings from word_embedding/glove.840B.300d.txt
```

- but when I test the model:
```bash
pytext test < textcnn_with_common_crawl_w2v.json
```
It's super fast and doesn't print load embedding message

- I also try to load model and config in code as following:
```python
from pytext import load_config, create_predictor
predictor =  create_predictor(load_config(CONFIG_PATH), MODEL_PATH)
```
It also loads very fast.

- In the predictor function, there is no use of the embedding path in word_feat config, featurizer.featurize just do tokenization:
```python
def _predict(workspace_id, feature_config, predict_net, featurizer, input):
    workspace.SwitchWorkspace(workspace_id)
    features = featurizer.featurize(InputRecord(**input))
    if feature_config.word_feat:
        for blob_name in feature_config.word_feat.export_input_names:
            converted_blob_name = convert_caffe2_blob_name(blob_name)
            workspace.blobs[converted_blob_name] = np.array(
                [features.tokens], dtype=str
            )
        workspace.blobs[""tokens_lens""] = np.array([len(features.tokens)], dtype=np.int_)
```

- I check that my model file is 21MB, it's not possible to include the large embedding in it.

what confuses me is that the model still works, output good results...",hi question train model bash train long time loading file take long time load test model bash test super fast print load message also try load model code following python import predictor also fast predictor function use path python input input check model file possible include large model still work output good,issue,positive,positive,positive,positive,positive,positive

You have to implement your own that can run a model or call a service or look up from a file to get the token embeddings for a given sentence ,e.g., ELMo.

Configuring pretrained embeddings in your feature_config is supported. See https://github.com/facebookresearch/pytext/blob/master/pytext/config/field_config.py#L78.

The field definition of PretrainedEmbeddingField to hold the embeddings is here: https://github.com/facebookresearch/pytext/blob/master/pytext/fields/pretrained_model_embedding_field.py#L12.

Given your feature_config definition the featurizer will be instantiated. Then the call to `featurizer.featurize()` should return the embeddings in addition to other data structures.

3- these warnings about softmax implicit dim choice (pooling.py) : 'just' deprecation.

I followed your suggestion saving modules and load them (via each `load_path`) in single-task training.

Anyway, even if I employed single-task mode (i.e., DocClassificationTask), unfortunately caffe2 export function still unworkable (only .pt came out as output). Then I tried to export by,
`$pytext export --output-path <my_caffe2> < <my_single_task_config>`

I did look at PairClassification, it solves a different problem. For PairClassification, the inputs are {label, doc1, doc2}. The goal is to classify the two documents as a 'pair'. Eg: the documents ""agree"", or ""contradict"", or neither agree nor contradict.

For SearchPairwiseRanking, the input is three documents: {query, response1, response2}. We want to find which response is better for the query in question. In this case (unlike PairClassification), the query is a document and needs to go through an embedding-->representation(LSTM, eg)-->MLP layers. 

Fundamentally, PairClassification is solving a classification problem, computing something like similarity(doc1, doc2) and mapping that to a label (eg., via a Softmax layer)
SearchPairwiseRanking is solving a relevance ranking problem, computing s1=similarity(query, doc1); s2=similarity(query, doc2), and then using f(s1, s2) as a loss function.

Hope this makes sense!",thanks comment look different problem label doc doc goal two agree contradict neither agree contradict input three query response response want find response better query question case unlike query document need go representation fundamentally classification problem something like similarity doc doc label via layer relevance problem query doc query doc loss function hope sense,issue,negative,positive,positive,positive,positive,positive
452878915,@kmalik22 Thanks a lot for the PR. It looks like you want a two-tower model that can represent a query and a document and learns by using pairwise ranking loss. Have you checked out `PairClassificationTask`: https://github.com/facebookresearch/pytext/blob/master/pytext/task/tasks.py#L162?

447551700,"**Torchtext** Provides a set of data-abstractions that helps reading and processing raw text data into PyTorch tensors, at the moment we use Torchtext in PyText for training-time data reading and preprocessing.

**AllenNLP** is a great NLP modeling library that is aimed at providing reference implementations and prebuilt state-of-the-art models, and make it easy to iterate on and research with models for different NLP tasks.

**PyText**
We've built PyText to be a rich NLP modeling library (along the lines of AllenNLP) but with production capabilities baked in the design from day 1. Examples are:

- We provide interfaces to make sure data preprocessing can be consistent between training and runtime 
- The model interfaces are compatible with ONNX and torch.jit 
- A core goal for us in the next few month is to be able to run models trained in PyText on mobile.

Among other differences like supporting distributed training and multi-task training.

That being said, so far our library of models has been mostly influenced by our current production use-cases, we are actively working on enriching this library with more models and tasks while keeping production capabilities and inference speed in mind.

447540729,"In my opinion 
###  Pytext

* based on torchtext;
* supports distributed training;
* supports multi-task training;
* currently only several tasks are out of the box.


### Allennlp
* Provides a lot of handful modules like Seq2VecEncoder, Seq2SeqEncoder.
* Provides a lot of handful utilities like  masked_softmax, masked_log_softmax .....  (You can get a lot of mask-related helper functions in AllenNLP, but there is no such thing in pytext).
* Provides the latest embeddings and tokenization out of the box, such as ELMo, BERT.
* configs are based on jsonnet, which is much more powerful than json (pytext uses json I think).
* Provides out of the box model/data_reader for a lot of popular NLP tasks.
* No distributed training.
* Multi-task training is not very straightforward in some cases.

(I just read the pytext doc, so I might be wrong)
