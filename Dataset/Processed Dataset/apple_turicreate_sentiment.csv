Yes i am doing a visual comparison between the two style loss settings - previously on Turicreate 5.8 setting it to 1e-1 for all four values would make a profound difference in the output vs 1e-4. However, with v6.4.1 there is almost zero difference (maybe a pixel change here and there) - hence why i don't think it is doing anything.

But you maybe correct - maybe it is working but with the new tensorflow-gpu there is very little change.

Anyway - i guess i will have to wait for an update that will allow me to change the style loss in a similar fashion to earlier versions.

Do you when there will be an update - or everything shifting to createML (which isn't as good IMHO).

What do you mean by ""no difference""? Are you just doing a visual inspection of outputted images or does it actually produce the exact same image? It might be that this hyper-parameter is just not that important.

change the params in the above file:

Then all the usual to start the learning
import turicreate as tc
tc.config.set_num_gpus(1)
style = tc.load_images('style')
content = tc.load_images('content')

model = tc.style_transfer.create(style, content, max_iterations = 5000) - i have done various combinations of this to see if i need to call advanced params e.g. definig advanced params in colabs, and adding _advanced_parameters = params to this model run.

The model runs with GPU :

What do you think i could try next?

btw i did not change the CUDA and Cudnn - they are the default versions in colabs i.e. 11.0, V11.0.221 and cudnn = 7.65

if i do change them to V10 and cudnn 7.4 i.e. what should work with tensor_flow GPU 2.0.4- in a fresh colabs book - then GPU is not accessed and only works with CPU. Although i dont think this is the issue.

Yeah, this is a bit opaque. It's basically the amount of state the model hold between predictions. A smaller number means the model hold less state. A larger number mean the model holds more state.

This is an example of a hyper parameter that can be tuned. There is no way to know the best value without experimenting. Build several different models with different values for this hyper parameter. Then evaluate each using a test set.

858104280,"Thanks for your reply Toby!

I figured it out. It was my mistake. I was running 7 of my models in parallel with the same raw data input but was using just one stateOutput variable for all of them,  which apparently was causing all models to return different activities but each model was stuck on the first activity it returned and would not change it over time despite me doing different dance steps. 

Once I changed my code so that each model has its own stateOutput variable (see attached swift file)  all models became responsive and it was interesting to see in real time how their predictions differ depending one model features and the level of lowPsss filtering of the data that I have applied during training and testing of the models. 

I have attached the relevant part of my code with a data sample for a 7 categories model. Please take a look if you have a few minutes. This is my very first ML project using Turicreate  so I may be doing some really stupid things. Any comments and suggestions are greatly appreciated.

715211059,"@waheed0332 So, I did try what you suggested and below are my findings:

1. So I first set up CUDA 10.1 and Cudnn 7.6 and then I built tensorflow(V2.3.1) from scratch and then installed turicreate (V6.4.1, this is the latest version as of now) but turicreate would not install and threw an error saying `turicreate is only compatible with tensorflow>2.1 and tensorflow<=2.0`(This is not the actual error but it basically said something very similar to this).
2. Then I tried to trick turicrteate by uninstalling the tensorflow I had (which is 2.3.1) and then installed installed a compatible version of tensorflow(2.0.0) and then installed turicreate. Then finally uninstall tensorflow-2.0.0 and again installed tensorflow -2.3.1 and this did give me a warning saying it's not compatible with turicreate but I did it anyway to test it. **But even after doing this I still ran into the same error I mentioned earlier** (_I know this step does sound very stupid but I did it only because I wanted to validate what @waheed0332 suggested_)

Even now the RAM gets full and then starts filling my swap memory and then once both are full the program gets killed. **I strongly believe somewhere the data management is not happening properly**.

The Data size I am using is a lot (roughly 36k images; 10-15 GB) but I don't think that should be create the problem.

Please let me know what can be done or how can we debug this even further or which part could create this issue and if anyone is facing a similar issue and has found a workaround.

Thanks a lot!

713256004,"Hi @KaunilD - Yes, SArrays are immutable and that's an important constraint we'll want to keep. Implementing this change in C++ would certainly be ideal, but I'd be fine with a Python layer only implementation. I'm sure your filter and boolean mask approach could work.

I think it would be simpler to just reuse as much of the slicing functionality as possible. Things certainly aren't always so simple but in general if you want to drop row `n` you could just do something like: `self[:n] + self[n+1:]`.",hi yes immutable important constraint want keep change would certainly ideal fine python layer implementation sure filter mask approach could work think would simpler reuse much slicing functionality possible certainly always simple general want drop row could something like self self,issue,positive,positive,positive,positive,positive,positive

I was able to go through the python and the respective c++ back ends (unity_*) and I realized :- since `SArrays` are required to be immutable, a drop / remove_row functionality is not implemented in the back-end. In case I have not missed anything might I suggest reusing the filters to create a new `SArray` using a boolean mask from the keys in the `__delitem__()` (this will not be inplace) ?

__PS:__ Since I am not entirely sure how an `SArray` is implemented (an array or a vector) the above suggestion is uninformed. I believe `unity_sarray_base` will allow me gain better insight into `SArray`.

So i have retried the different versions to see which ones work with advanced parameters

!pip uninstall -y mxnet
!pip install mxnet-cu100==1.4.0.post0

Works as expected

V6.0 runs with GPU - using mxnet (same code as above)
Strange results - looks like advanced parameters are being used since the output is not like 6.2.2 etc

V6.1 runs with GPU - using mxnet (same code as above)
Advanced parameters not accessed - result is same as V6.2.2 etc

V6.2 runs with GPU -
 !pip uninstall -y tensorflow
!pip install tensorflow-gpu

Advanced parameters not accessed - result is same as V6.2.2 etc

702957550,"Adding some context since @malcolmgreaves mentioned the poetry thread. For tools like poetry, because we do dependency resolution ahead of time, we rely on metadata first (when available). This means that the information served from PyPI is used first. If one is not available, we do inspect the platform wheels to identify the metadata.

Typically, in a best practice scenario, one would expect [PEP 508 Environment Markers](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0508/#environment-markers) to be relied upon to provide consistent metadata across all wheels. Unfortunately, setuptool based concention has most often been to rely upon conditional logic within `setup.py`, which leads us to the current situation of partial metadata.

From a personaly opinion perspective, it would be great if projects did this the best they can. For example your `install_requires` and `extras_require` could be something like this.

```py
install_requires = [
    ""Pillow>=5.2.0"",
    ""PrettyTable==0.7.2"",
    ""decorator>=4.0.9"",
    ""numpy>=1.19.2,<2.0.0"",
    ""pandas>=0.23.2"",
    ""requests>=2.9.1"",
    ""resampy==0.2.1"",
    ""scipy>=1.1.0"",
    ""six>=1.10.0"",
]

extras_require = {
    ':python_version < ""3.8""': [""coremltools==3.3""],
    ':python_version >= ""2.7"" and python_version < ""2.8"" or python_version >= ""3.5"" and python_version < ""3.6""': [
        ""llvmlite==0.31.0""
    ],
    ':python_version >= ""3.8.0"" and python_version < ""4.0.0""': [""coremltools==4.0b3""],
    ':sys_platform != ""darwin""': [
        ""tensorflow>=2.0.0,<2.1.0"",
        ""tensorflow>=2.0.0"",
        ""numba<0.51.0"",
    ],
    ':sys_platform == ""darwin""': [""tensorflow>=2.0.0""],
}
```

This is not the issue with my browser or anti-virus software because I have tried the same thing in a different environment in anaconda, and Jupyter worked normally. Because it is only in gl-env virtual environment that I encounter this odd issue, I assume that there is a problem with correct installation of Jupyter.

683178232,"@zhunhung - Thanks for letting me know it's the `ranking_factorization_recommender`. It would be super helpful if you could give a minimal reproduction example, i.e. one that uses some stubbed out data that is just a few rows.

According to [the documentation](https://apple.github.io/turicreate/docs/api/generated/turicreate.recommender.ranking_factorization_recommender.RankingFactorizationRecommender.recommend.html#turicreate.recommender.ranking_factorization_recommender.RankingFactorizationRecommender.recommend) for the `items` parameter this should work:
```
Restricts the items from which recommendations can be made. If items is an SArray, list, or SFrame with a single column, only items from the given set will be recommended. This can be used, for example, to restrict the recommendations to items within a particular category or genre. If items is an SFrame with user ID and item ID columns, then the item restriction is specialized to each user. For example, if items contains 3 rows with user U1 ‚Äì (U1, I1), (U1, I2), and (U1, I3) ‚Äì then the recommendations for user U1 are chosen from items I1, I2, and I3. By default, recommendations are made from all items present when the model was trained.
```

Does it work if the SFrame only has one column? In other words, does the following work?
```python
restricted_df = turicreate.SFrame({""item_id"":[1]})
results = recommender.recommend(users=users, items=restricted_df)
```

Also what about an SArray? Does the following work?
```python
restricted_df = turicreate.SArray([1])
results = recommender.recommend(users=users, items=restricted_df)

663208451,Thank you @abhishekpratapa. The issue for me is that TuriCreate has options that Create ML doesn't have and vice versa. How hard would it be to expose style shape parameters?

663198677,"@3DTOPO thanks for the question. Right now the style and content images take the same shape in TuriCreate.

If you need additional parameters, CreateML is currently a route you can use to achiever that.

I have seen many users facing problems while installing turicreate. I have spent two days to get it done.I thought that it will be my last try to install turicreate and if I still fail to install it, I will give up the course. I got it after several ways of trying. Read the below instructions to get turicreate into your Windows PC.

Before starting the installation of turicreate, read all the instructions first, and then start the installing process ensure the following:

- Your PC is running on Windows 10

- Uninstall Python3.8/any newer versions.

- Install Python 3.7

- While Installing Python 3.7, make sure that you click the add to path checkbox.

Now its time to install turicreate.

Follow each step one by one in this link: https://medium.com/@pam.thumbela/installing-turicreate-on-windows-10-534e147a4792

While going through the steps in the above link, make sure that:

- You open the Windows Powershell as an administrator at step-1.

- At step-3, install Ubuntu 18.04 LTS from Microsoft store. Don't install Ubuntu 20.04 LTS. This is where most people do mistake and find it difficult to install because in the last step it will throw an error if you use Ubuntu 20.04 LTS.

- Remember that whenever you want to work with turicreate, you should always open jupyter notebook from ubuntu itslef in the venv(virtual environment). Don't open jupyter notebook from command prompt.

Slow LSTM runtime in Keras seems to be a common issue. It **seems** our issue is that we have to use a pure-TensorFlow LSTM rather than a cuDNN-based LSTM. From [the Keras documentation](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/layers/LSTM):
```
Based on available runtime hardware and constraints, this layer will choose different
implementations (cuDNN-based or pure-TensorFlow) to maximize the performance.
If a GPU is available and all the arguments to the layer meet the requirement of the
CuDNN kernel (see below for details), the layer will use a fast cuDNN implementation.

The requirements to use the cuDNN implementation are:

activation == tanh
recurrent_activation == sigmoid
recurrent_dropout == 0
unroll is False
use_bias is True
Inputs are not masked or strictly right padded.
```
Our usage satisfies all of those requirements, except we're using `use_bias=False`. Using a bias here would probably make things a lot faster. However, if we use a bias, then additional parameters will need to be serialized when saving a model. This would prevent models trained in TuriCreate 6.4+ from being loaded in an earlier version of TuriCreate.

It continually gives me the (apparently harmless) no NUMA support warning. But that's something to do with Tensorflow's logging I assume, so I'll try to fix that.

Here's what I had to do get it working on WSL:

1. Reinstalled CUDA completely following [these instructions](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/wsl-user-guide/index.html) with one difference. It says:
```$ apt-get install -y cuda-toolkit-11-0```
But the link you provided says that you need CUDA 10.1. Therefore I did:
```$ apt-get install -y cuda-toolkit-10-1```

2. Then I installed cuDNN as outlined [here](https://stackoverflow.com/a/36978616).

3. In [LinuxGPU.md](https://github.com/apple/turicreate/blob/master/LinuxGPU.md) it suggests you uninstall `tensorflow` and instead install `tensorflow-gpu`. I'm not very familiar with tensorflow, but this seems to not be necessary anymore, as outlined here https://www.tensorflow.org/install/gpu with the newer versions of tensorflow? Instead of doing this, I kept tensorflow installed normally. And now it correctly uses the GPU after augmenting the images.

If you're using Turi Create 6.0+, as you correctly observed, looking at https://github.com/apple/turicreate/blob/master/src/toolkits/object_detection/od_data_iterator.cpp#L392-L411, we shuffle the data at the end of an epoch.

658116407,"Thanks for your reply Toby, I will try as you say and let you know.

Can I ask about the confidence of an observation, when I get a VNClassificationObservation and the label I can inspect the  VNConfidence which is normally around 0.9 - 1.0

I'm confused how this confidence score is related to the confidence threshold you can set in the model with a MLFeatureProvider eg:

`open var values = [
            ""iouThreshold"": MLFeatureValue(double: 0.45),
            ""confidenceThreshold"": MLFeatureValue(double: 0.5)
        ]`

Increasing the confidenceThreshold here does make the model stricter, but the VNConfidence is always close to 1.0

How do these number relate? is the confidenceThreshold something that happens before Non-maximum suppression?

Presumably I can set the confidenceThreshold low and apply a filter once I have the VNConfidence? Or I can set a higher confidenceThreshold and not filter using the VNConfidence? Would both give similar results?

Our [Task Focused Toolkits](https://apple.github.io/turicreate/docs/userguide/applications/) are particularly easy to use. Our lower level toolkits also try to do as much as possible for you. For example one hot encoding and dictionary vectorization are handled for you by TuriCreate. With most other tools you need to do this yourself.

2 - **Work with large dataset on your laptop**. TuriCreate make wide use of [SFrames](https://apple.github.io/turicreate/docs/api/generated/turicreate.SFrame.html), a tabular dataframe which is disk backed, so it scales to ""Big data"". Our toolkits are built on top of SFrame which mean you can create machine learning models using a dataset larger than the size of your RAM.

652011006,"TuriCreate does not yet support Python 3.8. We do support 2.7, 3.5, 3.6 and 3.7 on Linux.

@actcod01 - I think there is an issue with your Python environment. Based on the screenshot you shared, it looks like you are actually using Python 3.5: note the `cp35-cp35m` in the whl filenames for `turicreate` and `llvmlite`. `pip3` is failing when it tries to install one of TuriCreate dependencies. That dependency is pandas, which has recently dropped support for Python 3.5. For some reason `pip3` is failing because it is trying to install the most recent version of panda (which doesn't support 3.5) from source. Try running: `pip3 install --prefer-binary turicreate`

We are already tracking TuriCreate support for Python 3.8 in #3099. I'm going to close this issue as a duplicate, but let me know if you have more questions.",yet support python support think issue python environment based like actually python note pip failing install one dependency recently support python reason pip failing trying install recent version panda support source try running pip install already support python going close issue duplicate let know,issue,positive,neutral,neutral,neutral,neutral,neutral

@nishantnath - I agree a unit test here is largely redundant. However I still think it's worth doing since it will ensure we never accidentally remove this functionality. 

If I was going to add a unit test for this, I would probably add a new add a new testing class to our [image similarity unit test](https://github.com/apple/turicreate/blob/master/src/python/turicreate/test/test_image_similarity.py). The `setUpClass` method could create a model with a small dataset and pass it a kwarg value. 
Something like this:
```python
self.model = tc.image_similarity.create(data.head(), distance='squared_euclidean')
```

Then we could have a single test method that just checks the similarity model has that distance. I think it would be something like:
```python
self.assertEqual(
    self.model.similarity_model.distance[0][1],
    'squared_euclidean'
)
```",ponder unit test considering would passing downstream downstream function would unit redundant downstream support unit test param check happy add unit test provide direction unit test agree unit test largely redundant however still think worth since ensure never accidentally remove functionality going add unit test would probably add new add new testing class image similarity unit test method could create model small pas value something like python could single test method similarity model distance think would something like python,issue,positive,positive,neutral,neutral,positive,positive

644300427,"Hello @boaloysius, 

The scores on the leaves of each tree are added together, then transformed through a sigmoid function, i.e. `1 / (1 + exp(-x) )`.  This sigmoid function maps a score of 0 to probability 0.5 and all the results are between 0 and 1. 

Now, the probability threshold is set to 0.5, though the ""probability"" can be affected during training by adjusting the class weights at training time, so in that sense it's not really a true probability as the training can be biased one way or the other.  To do your own PR curve, though, you can have the predict() function output the raw probabilities instead of just a class prediction and threshold it yourself.",hello leaf tree added together sigmoid function sigmoid function score probability probability threshold set though probability affected training class training time sense really true probability training one way curve though predict function output raw instead class prediction threshold,issue,negative,positive,neutral,neutral,positive,positive

632125850,"Issue turicreate:

I am sorry for the delay I have caused in working on this, I could not really get a lot of time to work on it.
I have made the required changes and I have run into some issues and I would appreciate your input input in it. 
Below are the changes I made with respect to our conversation a few weeks before:

Image Analysis

1. Added get_deep_features function as discussed
2. Added support function to find if extracted feature column is present in the SFrame and if present it returns the column name of that feature otherwise raises error saying it‚Äôs not present. This function is used in image_classifier and image_similarity to find out if the feature column is of type image or extracted feature and if the feature column is not passed it will try to find the feature column with either type image or extracted_features. (This is very similar to _find_only_image_column in _internal_utils but I was not sure if I should add it there or in image_analysys but I ended up adding it in image_analysis itself)

Image classifier

1. Changed the create function to accept feature column in either Image format or extracted feature format (of the model in use).
2. If the feature column is not mentioned by the user then the algorithm first checks If there is a column with data type of extracted feature (of the model in use) and if not present it chooses the Image type column
3. Changed _extract_features to extract features only when the datatype of the feature column is Image and do nothing and pass the feature column as it is when the data type of the feature of the type extracted features (of the model in use)
4. Accept the data type array (this will be the data type of the extracted feature, if present) in functions: predict_topk, _canonize_input, predict and classify.

Image similarity

1. Changed the create function to accept feature column in either Image format or extracted feature format (of the model in use).
2. If the feature column is not mentioned by the user then the algorithm first checks If there is a column with data type of extracted feature (of the model in use) and if not present it chooses the Image type column
3. Changed _extract_features to extract features only when the datatype of the feature column is Image and do nothing and pass the feature column as it is when the data type of the feature of the type extracted features (of the model in use)
4. Accept the data type array (this will be the data type of the extracted feature, if present) in functions: query

Test image classifier and test image similarity

1. Changed the get_test_data function to also include columns with extracted features for the corresponding images (from ‚Äúawesome_image‚Äù column)
2. After making the changes in create functions of both image_classification and image_similarity, they accept the feature in either Image form or array form (extracted feature column type) and the test cases are changed to include models that are trained with both types of features.‚Ä® 
Below are the issues I am facing in detail:

After finishing all this, I tested the same with both c++ unit test cases and python unit test cases:

1. It passed all the c++ test cases
2. It passed all the python test cases except test_export_coreml (in test_image_similarity) and test_export_coreml_predict (in test_image_classifier). It throws the error : ValueError: Cannot call 'resize' on objects that are not either an Image or SArray of Images. And as far as I know this is happening because the module predict function in coremltools accepts only Image as data type and I am not sure where to make these changes


Please let me know if the approach I have taken is correct and what do you think of it and if you want I pull put out a WIP pull request for you to check what I have done.
Please share your thoughts!

631231093,"If this helps anyone, I was successful by rolling back to TuriCreate version 5.7.1 which uses MXNet along with renting some powerful GPUs (g3.8xlarge - 2 Tesla M60s) on AWS. 18,000 iterations took around 2.5 hours to train with 32 style images and 458 training images. 

TuriCreate 6.2.2 is easy to install but I think somewhere along the line of configuring a Linux AWS EC2 environment and aligning all the dependency version requirements for a particular TensorFlow version is not clear. 

AWS has documentation on updating the runtime version of CUDA but I imagine the problem I might be having is located with the original installation of the CUDA driver and cuDNN versions by AWS. They are the most recent versions of those libraries and of course incompatible. So even though it appears I am updating the runtime versions, the original driver installation must be causing the problems.

As a front end developer I can respect the complexity of setting up environments. Installing GPU drivers on a machine rented by the hour is simply venturing into territory that it is time consuming and complex. It was easier to roll back to what I previously had working on AWS with MXNet and TuriCreate 5.7.1. TuriCreate is very interesting, I'll be excited when the issues similar to #3190 are resolved. Ultimately TuriCreate 6.2.2 would be cheaper and faster for me since I could train on my Mac Vega 20 and wouldn't need to use AWS or Linux.

https://www.tensorflow.org/install/source suggests the following for GPU as did Toby in the comments above.

Version tensorflow-2.0.0, Python version 2.7, 3.3-3.7, Compiler GCC 7.3.1, cuDNN 7.4, and CUDA 10.0

I have tried using tensorflow-gpu==2.0 and tensorflow==2.0

My cuDNN is definitely 7.4

My CUDA version is 10.0
ubuntu@:~$ cat /usr/local/cuda/version.txt
CUDA Version 10.0.130

However my gcc version 7.5.0. Hopefully that is not the issue. I either get TuriCreate to run on the CPU with tensorflow==2.0 or if I switch to tensorflow-gpu==2.0 I get the same error you get. 

This is the error I get from Jupyter notebook. 

E tensorflow/stream_executor/cuda/cuda_dnn.cc:319] Loaded runtime CuDNN library: 7.4.1 but source was compiled with: 7.6.0.  CuDNN library major and minor version needs to match or have higher minor version in case of CuDNN 7.0 or later version. If using a binary install, upgrade your CuDNN library.  If building from sources, make sure the library loaded at runtime is compatible with the version specified during compile configuration.

This seems to say to me that tensorflow was compiled using 7.6 instead of what it suggests on their site (7.4). Maybe this is the problem.

If i look at nvidia-smi I can see it says CUDA 10.2 but I have updated CUDA using instructions from AWS. https://docs.aws.amazon.com/dlami/latest/devguide/tutorial-base.html and I know the cuda folder has been updated to use 10.0. But maybe this is possibly the problem.

I'd be happy to train on my mac but there are outstanding issues others have reported with style transfer training on AMD GPUs. It trains really fast with my AMD Radeon Pro Vega 20 but as others have suggested, the results are not usable. 

I keep looking at AWS Ubuntu and CUDA to see if I can get it working. If this is the only path. I am eager to get it to train again. I'm not sure what else to try at this point. If anyone understands this error or has been successful at creating a training environment on linux with a GPU maybe they can share their steps or shed some light on what configuration might be missing. Otherwise I'll patiently wait until it works on an AMD GPU. 

I will be excited to get it working again. It's really cool.

Just wondering if you know how to fix the advanced parameters issues (i.e. style loss and other advanced parameters not being utilised to train the model) when using Nvidia GPU on Google Colabs (using tensorflow-gpu). Has this issue popped up before? 

@robertallenmartin - i have gone up to 40,000 iterations on the Mac AMD GPU - no improvement from the 10,000 iterations unfortunately.

627963417,"Thanks Toby. I believe this is the problem as well. My perspective is from a front end developer point of view. Setting up environments like this is uncommon but I am usually successful if I have a good direction. With your comments, I went back to TensorFlows documentation and as they suggest I used Docker instead to build the environment. Again, I can create Turi Create models on the CPU with no problem using these docker images below, but unfortunately still no GPU. 

docker run --gpus all nvidia/cuda:10.0-base nvidia-smi

docker run --gpus all -it --rm --name thedockername tensorflow/tensorflow:2.0.0-gpu-py3-jupyter bash

I feel like I am missing some configuration step with the connection between CUDA and Tensorflow. Tensorflow documentation makes it seem like I only need to run their Docker image for all to work. The docker code above lets me run Turi Create but it still only trains with the CPU. 

The only thing left I can see from the Tensorflow GPU documentation is there are some vague instructions about using Bazel. Do you know if this is what I am missing? Im looking now to see how you install this in a docker container. The documentation isn't very clear to me.

At the end of the day, if there is an easier way is to create an environment for Turi Create Style Transfer I am open to any suggestions. I'm using AWS and Linux because I happen to know it better, and as far as I know the style transfer can't be trained on my Mac GPU. But if there is a more simple way to use a GPU in the cloud, my end goal is only to do the training fast and export a coreML model. Thanks again for your comments.

This is what my AWS linux system seems to have now with the docker build. It doesn't seem to match versions exactly but its what the tensorflow docker image created.

At the end, The model was detecting the object very well (failing in shadowed images, probably bc of the lack of training with this kind of data) , but was not achieving the detection speed we needed,  and running it inside an AVCaptureSession (predicting each 640x480 image delivered by the delegate) the phone's temperature after a minute was similar to the sun 

Finally we decided to take another approach that took us more time to integrate , but have similar detection rate but was way less demanding in the phone

Is this an out-of-memory issue as OP has suggested? It seems to make sense as this is occurring each time I have tried it at exactly the same point in the loop - after iteration 1,540 - but it seems somewhat odd as I would have expected all images to be loaded into memory at the start of the training cycle? And with ~90GB of system memory, I would have thought this would be plenty for around 50 training images.

Any ideas?",problem exactly point training loop attempt model trying train initial size python running ti ram available script training training point iteration determined script several simply exactly shown input background augmented time percent complete truncated successfully feature column column create model setting warning removed future version long term setting iteration loss time truncated issue make sense time tried exactly point loop iteration somewhat odd would loaded memory start training cycle system memory would thought would plenty around training,issue,negative,positive,positive,positive,positive,positive

So if we want to call this from `tc.image_analysis.get_deep_features` we need to send SFrame dataset in `get_deep_features` or we need to change the `extract_feature` function in `_image_feature_extractor`. 
I personally feel like we should change the input parameters of `tc.image_analysis.get_deep_features` from SArray to SFrame. This will make sure we don't have to change a lot of the code and yet the same can be achieved by just passing `dataset`, `feature`, `model_name` and `batch_size`. And even when people want to save features they can directly save the the output as it has a direct association of images and the features (This is a side benefit and it's advantages are subjective and might not be as important).

615551235,"@NeerajKomuravalli - Sorry for the delay. I wanted to discuss this matter with my manager before responding. We think having one function under `tc.image_analysis` would be best.

I think it should look like `tc.image_analysis.get_deep_features(images, model_name)`
Where `images` is an SArray of images and `model_name` is a string.

Below is a list of things that will should to be done. There is likely more needed but this should be most of it.

# Get Deep Features
- [ ] Create `tc.image_analysis.get_deep_features` and write the docstring
- [ ] Parameter checking for `tc.image_analysis.get_deep_features`. Make sure `images` is a non-empty SArray of images. Make sure `model_name` is a string with one of the three allowed values (note ‚ÄúVisionFeaturePrint_Scene‚Äù is only allowed on certain macOS version -- see existing code). If any of the parameter aren't right the user should get an informative error message. 
- [ ] Implement `tc.image_analysis.get_deep_features`. You should be able to just use the existing code from either the image classifier or image similarity.

# Image Classifier
- [ ] Modify code to check if the input are deep features. We already do [something similar for the sound classifier](https://github.com/apple/turicreate/blob/ccc5eb9d53c9dbf58d111fd81a9458b3cc6fd4d4/src/python/turicreate/toolkits/sound_classifier/sound_classifier.py#L365). Creating a helper function here would probably be good so you can also use it for image similarity too.
- [ ] If deep features are not passed in, the code should just use `tc.image_analysis.get_deep_features` to get the deep features. This is so we don't have duplicated code. 
- [ ] Update the docstring.
- [ ] Write image classifier unit tests for this new functionality.

# Image Similarity
- [ ] Modify code to check if the input are deep features. 
- [ ] If deep features are not passed in, the code should use tc.image_analysis.get_deep_features`. 
- [ ] Update the docstring.

I think adding a new module (say we call it `deep_features`) would be a little strange since there would only be one thing inside that of that module. If we add:
`tc.deep_features.get_deep_features(image_sarray, model_name)`.
There isn't going to be anything else under `tc.deep_features`.

Another option would be to add a new module and make each model have its own function, i.e. remove the `model_name` parameter. Then we would have three method: 
`tc.deep_features.Resnet(image_sarray)`
`tc.deep_features.Squeezenet(image_sarray)`
`tc.deep_features.VisionFeaturePrint_Scene(image_sarray)`
This might be a cleaner solution.

The ability to easily create a learning model with simple coding without the need to try the hyperparameters needed to create an existing learning model is very attractive and amazing.
With TuriCreate I can draw graphs without long coding, and I am very grateful.


Unfortunately, there are few types of trained models available.In the image classification of the field that I am studying, ResNet50 is too deep and does not provide much accuracy (about 85%). The VGG16 is more than 95% accurate, so I want to deploy that model to iOS.

TuriCreate does not have the Data Augment function of Keras. (It is implemented in CreateML)
It is necessary to generate a large number of learning images with a self-made program, which takes a long time to read and consumes a large amount of memory.

Some may say that you can use Raspberry Pi or JetsonNano, but the big breakthrough in my research area is that it can be implemented on a smartphone.

However, TuriCreate requires ‚Äú.model‚Äù, and CoreMLTools only supports conversion to ‚Äú.mlmodel‚Äù.

Since it has been pointed out that the accuracy has been reduced when converting to "".mlmodel"", there is also an idea that TuriCreate should confirm it before implementing it.

The unit tests for Style Transfer also pass with V2 behavior enabled. Although some additional verification should probably be done.

Changes will need to be made for Object Detection. It appears those changes will be similar to the changes made for other toolkit.

599825181,"@navanchauhan - you should be able to manually classify a single example.

SVM classifiers work by calculating a ""margin"" value, which is the distance of the example from the hyperplane.

Take a look at [the SVM page of our User Guide](https://apple.github.io/turicreate/docs/userguide/supervised-learning/svm.html) for more information here. Also you can get the margin value from an `svm_classifer` by passing `output_type=""margin""` to the `predict` function - see the [API documentation](https://apple.github.io/turicreate/docs/api/generated/turicreate.svm_classifier.SVMClassifier.predict.html#turicreate.svm_classifier.SVMClassifier.predict).

If this margin value is greater than or equal to zero, one class is predicted, else the other class is predicted.

If both `a` and `b` are numerical values, it's easy to calculate the margin. Simply multiple the value of `a` and `b` with their corresponding coefficient, then add the intercept. [Here](https://github.com/apple/turicreate/blob/8700c39388c4784a79ac8a4f763ac1346ad9cf83/src/toolkits/supervised_learning/linear_svm.cpp#L260) is our code for doing this.

As you can see from the graph below, the label distribution is not that great, however the one with the most bboxes is not the one that is always predicted. It seems to always be the one at index 1 of my class list (from model.classes).

```
model = tc.object_detector.create(train_data, batch_size=16, max_iterations=100)

There are no forbidden characters for the labels.

Floats should be fine.

---------

A few questions: 
1 - What operating system are you using to train your model?
2 - What is your label distribution like? Are there a lot more bounding boxes for one label? Is this the label that is always getting predicted?
3 - Try passing in `max_iterations=1` into `create`. Does that model always predict the same label?

The data has a few columns:
date_time: str

| date_time | accept_language | ua  | lindo_events |      data       |

| str       | str             | str | List[dict]   | dict(id=""abcd"") |
+-----------+-----------------+-----+--------------+-----------------+
```

Each dictionary inside lindo_events and data has less than 20 keys, so each row is relatively small, but overall I have 50M+ of these rows.

Particularly data has a key called id, and one row only has 1 unique id.

So basically I'm trying to unpack the data's id into it's seperate column, and then packing all the columns except the id into one column, so it will be:

```
+-----+------------------------------+
| id  |         packed_data          |
+-----+------------------------------+
| str | dict of everything except id |
+-----+------------------------------+
```

Once I groupby user ID, I would get left with a list of dictionaries with their datetime

```

+-----+------------------------------------------------------------------+
| str | [{dict of everything except id}, {dict of everything except id}] |
+-----+------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

I'll try sorting and see if it works, otherwise if it doesn't I'll do a groupby and count and see if there's an ID with millions of these, and then maybe individually run groupby on the counts that are over an amount as suggested by @hoytak. If it is pretty distributed, which I rarely see on these type of datasets (web interactions), I'll try slice and groupby.

@hoytak 

I haven't counted exactly, but I think there's less than a hundred dictionaries per id by running a smaller subset of the data.

I'm trying to group them into a list of lists, where each list in the lists are events (each row) and the time between each event is less than a specified duration of time, for example an hour.

```
+-----+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

Yes, good point. Honestly, I suspect most clients of Apple's Combine framework do use a push model, by requesting unlimited demand from a root publisher that is ultimately event-based. (To respond to e.g. user interaction on a UI widget or a notification).

In our case, we want to use the back-pressure mechanism built into Combine to instead use a pull model, where the iterator only emits another batch on demand.

1. Yes, indeed, the context info now can be incorporated in this way, but it's more like viewing it as a common classification problem and it loses the power of efficiently modeling 2-order or higher order feature interactions like Collaborative Filtering/ Factorization Machine does. It's actually totally fine , just making me curious if it'll be better using vanilla Factorization Machines.

2. For the first point you make, we did try your suggestion by modeling user with the list of his purchased items. But we didn't find any performance improvement compared to simply modeling user with a categorical variable. The only advantage I can see is it can help reduce the number of coefficients. Any other reason?

3. Viewing the problem as multi-class classification instead of binary is very interesting. For me, the greatest advantage is you don't need to worry about negative sampling from the unobserved, which might be quite complicated if the model includes context info. Is it why you suggested doing this?",sorry late reply really appreciate good suggestion quite different somehow interesting actually tried yes indeed context incorporated way like common classification problem power efficiently modeling higher order feature like collaborative factorization machine actually totally fine making curious better vanilla factorization first point make try suggestion modeling user list find performance improvement simply modeling user categorical variable advantage see help reduce number reason problem classification instead binary interesting advantage need worry negative sampling unobserved might quite complicated model context,issue,positive,positive,neutral,neutral,positive,positive

582068378,"It can be incorporated with this model, but the issue is that the optimization to train it can be extremely hard and the resulting model can be extremely finicky.  We could never get it working reliably in production -- it was way too sensitive.  

In your case, you're lucky with having only 60 items. I would actually treat this as a multiclass classification problem.  Set the problem up like this:

For each observation, have as features: 
1. A binary vector of 0s and 1s indicating which items other than the observed item that the user interacted with.  In TC, this can be done as a categorical list of strings e.g. [""item1"", ""item5"", ""item45""] . If there are ratings there, use a dictionary instead.  This is how the user data is encoded. 
2. All the relevant side information. 
3. The target class would be the item the user interacted with. 

I would trial run this with logistic_classifier, then the boosted_trees_classifier would give you the best accuracy. 

Then, on prediction, get the probability_vector type output, zero out all the items the user has interacted with, and rank recommendations by probability.

581705877,"Hi @hoytak,
The dataset is quite ""imbalanced"". I'm having 2 million users, 60 items and around 10 million observations. 

The side info is complex. There are different types of side info including: timestamp for each observation, product specs for each item, demographic info for each user, etc.. And more importantly, we have several other types of user/item interactions in addition to the observations, such as when/where/how the users use the items after purchase. We're still experimenting on different side info, not sure how much will be relevant yet.

I see Factorization Machine (_Steffen Rendle, ‚ÄúFactorization Machines,‚Äù in Proceedings of the 10th IEEE International Conference on Data Mining (ICDM), 2010._) is in your references. And based on my understanding, any side info (including context info) can be incorporated into a CF model if using FM. So it made me confused when I found it didn't support context info incorporation.

                	self.__out_buffer = numpy.append(self.__out_buffer, window)
                # print('__out_buffer size %i'%self.__out_buffer.size)

    def get_voice_samples(self):
        return self.__out_buffer
```

Then a function we'll use to split the sample values into 1 second intervals
```
import itertools

def split_seq(iterable, size):
    it = iter(iterable)
    item = list(itertools.islice(it, size))
    while item:
        yield item
        item = list(itertools.islice(it, size))
```
```
import itertools
import os
import scipy.io.wavfile as wf
import numpy
import sox
from pathlib import Path
```
Now here is where we walk the files, create a new folder for the collection of folders, and then split them up into one second files. 
```

    newOutputPath = outputPath + newLastPathComponent
    for subdir, dirs, files in os.walk(path):

                path.parent.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True) 
                new_path = Path(path.parent.as_posix() + '/' + path.stem)
                wav = wf.read(fileLocation)
                ch = wav[1]
                sr = wav[0]
                vad = VoiceActivityDetection()
                vad.process(ch)
                voice_samples = vad.get_voice_samples()
                splitSamples = list(split_seq(voice_samples, int(sr * 1)))
                for index, splitSilenceBuffers in enumerate(splitSamples):
                    filePath = ""%s_%s.wav"" % (str(new_path), index)

                        wf.write(filePath, sr, array)
```
And this is where we take 10 percent of the files in each folder, of each speaker, for testing.

Random sampling:
We want to acquire the following two properties for random sampling:
1. Each sample in a mini-batch has different behaviors:
Our image augmenter creates an array with length of batch_size, and uses a session to run it.
```
#construct the graph
self.img_tf = [tf.placeholder(tf.float32, [None, None, 3]) for x in range(0, self.batch_size )]
self.ann_tf = [tf.placeholder(tf.float32, [None, 6]) for x in range(0, self.batch_size )]
self.resize_op_batch = []
for i in range(0, self.batch_size):
       aug_img_tf, aug_ann_tf = complete_augmenter(self.img_tf[i], self.ann_tf[i], (output_height, output_width))
       self.resize_op_batch.append([aug_img_tf, aug_ann_tf])

#get augmenter output
aug_output = self.session.run(self.resize_op_batch)
```
We expect each element in aug_output has different output, and this can be achieved by assigning different seeds for each sample.
For simplicity we can look at the following behavior when each operation is a simple `tf.random.uniform` operation
```
# fixed seed for each sample
opt_batch = [tf.random.uniform([],0,1,seed=0), tf.random.uniform([],0,1,seed=0), tf.random.uniform([],0,1,seed=0)]
with tf.Session() as session:
        print(session.run(opt_batch))
```
The code produces something like
```
[0.232, 0.232, 0.232]
```
This is not what we want since each element in a batch produces the same result.
So I first use the user-given seed to generate an random seed array with length of the batch size in the beginning, and then assign the seed to each element.
```
np.random.seed(random_seed)
self.random_seed = np.random.randint(low=0, high=2**32-1, size=self.batch_size)
for i in range(0, self.batch_size):
        aug_img_tf, aug_ann_tf = complete_augmenter(self.img_tf[i], self.ann_tf[i], output_height, output_width, self.random_seed[i])
        self.resize_op_batch.append([aug_img_tf, aug_ann_tf])
```
This ensure that each element has different behavior.

2. Each mini-batch produce different results.
Again for each iteration, we want to ensure we get different results. This can be achieved by create only one session and run the augmenter every single time using the session.

What the master doing now is that it basically creates a new session for each iteration,
which will produce the same result across all iterations, which is not good.
```
#construct the graph
self.opt_batch = []
batch_size = 3
for i in range(batch_size):
    self.opt_batch.append(tf.random.uniform([],0,1,seed=i))

#for each iteration a new session is created
#say we run 3 iterations
with tf.Session() as session:
   print(session.run(self.opt_batch)
with tf.Session() as session:
   print(session.run(self.opt_batch)
with tf.Session() as session:
   print(session.run(self.opt_batch)
```
This gets results like
```
[0.231, 0.456, 0.771]
[0.231, 0.456, 0.771]
[0.231, 0.456, 0.771]
```
which is not what we want.

So I change the code to have only one session, for each iteration we use the same session to run the graph
```
self.session = tf.Session()
print(self.session.run(self.opt_batch))
print(self.session.run(self.opt_batch))
print(self.session.run(self.opt_batch))
```
This produces
```
[0.231, 0.456, 0.771]
[0.561, 0.032, 0.112]
[0.345, 0.987, 0.321]
```
which is nice haha.

Reproducibility
In the image augmenter, we basically have two kinds of random operation:
(1)The first one is the four tensorflow operations:
`tf.image.random_hue`, `tf.image.random_brightness`, `tf.image.random_saturation`, and `tf.image.random_contrast`,
like what is reported in https://stackoverflow.com/questions/38469632/tensorflow-non-repeatable-results/40247201, `tf.set_random_set` at the graph level sadly is useless for some operations. And these four operations belong to this as I observed.
So I set the seed for each operation when constructing the graph.
```
tf.image.random_hue(image, max_delta=max_hue_adjust, seed=tf_seed)
...
tf.image.random_contrast(image, lower=np.exp(-log_con), upper=np.exp(log_con), seed=tf_seed)
```

(2) The second one is we use `np.random.uniform` throughout the code in `tf.numpy_function`.
Again, `tf.set_random_seed()` doesn't seem to work, and also `np.random.seed()` doesn't work either (I guess it is because the Numpy function is wrapped in tensorflow haha).
So I replaced every `numpy.random.uniform` in the code by a `tf.random.uniform` tensor.
```
#say if crop_augmenter has 5 np.random.uniform operations included
#I generate a random tensor random_nums with length 5 and pass it as an input
random_nums = tf.random.uniform([5], 0., 1., seed=seed_tf)
img_tf, ann_tf = tf.numpy_function(func=crop_augmenter, inp=[img_tf, ann_tf, random_nums], Tout=[tf.float32, tf.float32])
```

Ah! Thanks for the clarification! I see your point. 

(each line represents a thread)
I thought we can do, date parp in one step in parallel, and trigger G/Cpu process in parallel too,

|-prep-| ->  | -G/C- |
|-prep-| ->  | -G/C- |
...
|-prep-| ->  | -G/C- |

But in reality, we do data preparation batch by batch.

without pipeline, 
|-prep-|-G/C-|-prep-|-G/C-|-prep-|-G/C-|-prep-|-G/C-| ...

with the pipeline, (with assumption prep time is longer than G/Cpu processing time)
__________| -G/C- |  |-G/C- |   |-G/C- |
|-prep---|-prep---|-prep---|-prep---| ...

if G/Cpu processing time is longer than data prep time,
_____________________________| -G/C--------|  
____________________| -G/C--------|  
__________| -G/C--------|  
|-prep---|-prep---|-prep---|-prep---| ...

In this way, I think this pipelining is very valuable and can improve the overall throughput.

It's better to keep data preparation time less than G/Cpu processing time, then we can keep G/Cpu busy all the time.

For my understanding, it would be nice to tell me that 'hamster' is not in training set so I can add 'hamster' to my training set in order to get better knowledge (under the assumption that cat images probably don't share deep features with hamsters). 

In practice, the test set serves a simulation as a production environment. True that production may have unseen data and the cycle to figure this out might be very long. That's why the training set could have unseen data over the test set.

Usually, people would promote the model to production if it works well in test set. The test set data distribution is actually very important. I think rarely people want to simulate the production with unseen data in the test set during the model training phase.

If the test set has unseen data over the training set, probably nothing I can do but add unseen data to the training set to start it over, which might be the handiest way to improve overall accuracy for the test set before promoting the model to production.

So I think the OD is doing the right thing now whatever training/test dataset has same labels or not (just ignore the labels not in the training data is totally fine.)

The purpose here is to warn user only when they create model with explicit 'classes' input argument provided.

Say the user use
```
model = tc.object_detector.create(dataset, classes=['catt', 'dog']),
```
when the training dataset has labels 'cat' and 'dog'.
We should warn the user that they might provide invalid 'classes' argument here (typo in this case),
since the model treat the user-defined 'classes' as ground truth labels instead of the labels inferred from the training dataset.

This is part of my point. OD is not a classifier. Asking a detector to detect things in an image that happens to have objects that the detector wasn't trained on isn't inherently problematic, in the same way that (absent multi-label classification), it's inherently wrong to ask a classifier to classify an image whose one true label is one the classifier doesn't know about.

Suppose that you have a dataset of images annotated with cat and dog bounding boxes. It feels weird to me if you later go back, add additional annotations for ""hamster"" to a _test set_ and now get a warning.

The behavior should be: 

1. Once loaded, the SFrame is assumed to be present on disk for the duration of use. 
2. When a model is saved, the relevant SFrames are present in the directory of saving (sometimes by hardlink, sometimes by writing, but it always exists in that directory).

562819269,"The only way that you will get a scalar as output is if you only have one feature. Linear regression output is the vector x such that ||Ax - y|| has the min value. Where A is a matrix given by the dataset and the columns are the features and y is the source of true from the dataset. So you can see that x needs to have as many entries as columns of A or as features your dataset has. The only way it can be a scalar is if A has only one feature. Is this your case? Do you have a single feature? 

If you have a feature where the entry is a vector of dimension n the you can expanded into n features and do regression on those n features. For example, say you have a single feature that is given by two dimensional vectors [v1,u1], [v2,u2]...[vm,um]. Then you can consider instead of one feature two features, namely the first one by v1, v2 ..vm and the second to be u1,u2..um  and do regression as usual. It does not mater that is two dimensional you can do the same with any number of dimension.

@hoytak - We run our unit tests via the `test_wheel.sh` script. This uses the `install_python_toolchain.sh` [to create its' virtual environment](https://github.com/apple/turicreate/blob/ab8bdf42a62baeb8b66c753fbdfdfd944234869d/scripts/test_wheel.sh#L80). `install_python_toolchain.sh` use [the requirement file that you're editing to install its' dependencies](https://github.com/apple/turicreate/blob/ad9c748aa4b255f3c57f6a08da967d9785073664/scripts/install_python_toolchain.sh#L39).

So if we make this change without also making #2775, we will be running unit tests using a different version of `coremltools` than our user will get when they install `turicreate`.

I think both this change and #2275 should be the same pull request. What is the purpose of separating these change into two separate pull requests?",one change go release upgrade version running unit different set dependency get sure mean run unit via script create virtual environment use requirement file install make change without also making running unit different version user get install think change pull request purpose separating change two separate pull,issue,positive,positive,neutral,neutral,positive,positive

557752439,"## Overview
Multiple styles wasn't working in TuriCreate because of this silly problem.

## Issue
- The instance norm layers which determine the stylistic feature of an image are supplied by a class called the `InstanceNormDataLoader`. This data loader takes care of all of the `beta` and `gamma` weights during inference as well as the `velocity` and `momentum` buffers during training.

- Two methods exist that need to be overridden on this data loader: the `gamma` and the `beta` method.

- The instanceNorm layer in mps only supports one style meaning one `gamma` and `beta` pair.

- To circumvent this limitation, in the InstanceNormDataLoader class we created `NSArrays` to store the different `gamma` and `beta` values.

- We used an indexing variable `styleIndex` to select the different `gamma` and `beta` values for different styles.

- To export the weights after training I added a concat to the `gamma` and `beta` methods so that all of the `gamma` and `beta` weights for all styles are concatenated into one contagious block of `NSData`

- This worked during export because the part of the style transfer application TuriCreate owned was aware that these were concatenated `gamma` and `beta` values.

- this didn't work during `predict` because these concatenated values were truncated by MPS since they had no awareness that these exported `gamma` and `beta` values were for multiple styles.

- Since the gamma and beta values were contagious the truncation happened to the `gamma` and `beta` values for the first index only.

## The Solution

- Separating the methods that exported the `gamma` and `beta` weights and the methods that gave the current `gamma` and current `beta` weights for the selected style, solved this issue.

- calling `gammaWeights` and `betaWeights` gave the callee the concatenated values of `gamma` and `beta` weights for all styles

- calling `gamma` and `beta` only gave the `gamma` and `beta` values for the current selected style.

In conclusion `MPS` was happy and `TuriCreate` exported all the weights it needed for multi style style-transfer.",overview multiple working silly problem issue instance norm determine stylistic feature image class data loader care beta gamma inference well velocity momentum training two exist need data loader gamma beta method layer one style meaning one gamma beta pair circumvent limitation class store different gamma beta used indexing variable select different gamma beta different export training added gamma beta gamma beta one contagious block worked export part style transfer application aware gamma beta work predict truncated since awareness gamma beta multiple since gamma beta contagious truncation gamma beta first index solution separating gamma beta gave current gamma current beta selected style issue calling gave gamma beta calling gamma beta gave gamma beta current selected style conclusion happy style,issue,negative,positive,neutral,neutral,positive,positive

You're right Nick. So MXNET uses the NAG optimizer which takes `lr` and `momentum` and TF uses Adam optimizer which also does not use `momentum`. I meant to replace Adam. I believe the implementation of NAG in TF is https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/compat/v1/train/MomentumOptimizer which will take in both `lr` and `momentum`. Setting `use_nesterov=True`. This may fix it.",like went one might require experimentation right nick nag momentum also use momentum meant replace believe implementation nag take momentum setting may fix,issue,negative,positive,positive,positive,positive,positive

You tried a really good experiment. Clearly, loss is going down but, not as fast as you'd want to make a difference in accuracy.

This means we need to tune the hyper-parameter for this model. Could you try increasing learning rate? You could try different values - like 0.02, 0.03, 0.05, 0.1, 0.15, etc. Here's how you'd do that:

```
let configuration = MLModelConfiguration()

// requests training loop run for 10 iterations and use 0.02 learning rate
configuration.parameters = [MLParameterKey.epochs : 10, MLParameterKey.learningRate : 0.02]

let progressHandlers = MLUpdateProgressHandlers(forEvents: .epochEnd,
                                                progressHandler: progressHandler,
                                                completionHandler: completionHandler)

let updateTask = try MLUpdateTask(forModelAt: updatableModelURL,
                                  trainingData: trainingData,
                                  configuration: configuration,
                                  progressHandlers: progressHandlers)

// start the update process
updateTask.resume()
```

`progressHandler` would look something like:

```
func progressHandler(_ context: MLUpdateContext) {
    // print context.metrics[MLMetricKey.loss]
}
```

See if loss goes down for each epoch.

A workaround would be for your script to first get the file from `s3fs`, save it to disk, then read it with `read_csv`. This is obviously non-optimal from both a performance and code cleanliness perspective, but until `read_csv` supports reading from a Python `File` object (and the [existing S3 bug](https://github.com/apple/turicreate/issues/2278) is fixed) this may be your best bet.

When running the pandas `read_csv` with `s3://` as a prefix it doesn't seem to pickup the endpoint url correctly. Hence why I instantiated S3FileSystem with `endpoint_url`. AFAIK there is no way to specify an endpoint when calling `read_csv` within pandas and I'm using the solution [described here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/35803601/reading-a-file-from-a-private-s3-bucket-to-a-pandas-dataframe/43838676) in the test scenario.

If I pass the instantiated `S3FileSystem` to `tc.SFrame.read_csv` then I get the following error

Ah, I see what happened (via visual code debugging). You created a shadow `opts_` data member here:
https://github.com/apple/turicreate/blob/944a7e3ae6f98b2eefa1628e63415c56fb16a54a/src/ml/neural_net/tf_compute_context.cpp#L199
This `tf_image_augmenter::opts_` variable shadows the `float_array_image_augmenter::opts_` from the parent class. The correct fix is just to delete the shadow `opts_` and to use `get_options()` directly. No need to write `tf_image_augmenter::get_options()`, just `get_options()` will suffice. Your class inherits this stuff from the base class.

I understand, but I don't want to call a virtual function (`init_model`) in my constructor. 

I think `clone` is good design. I can use the constructor. `init_model_spec` helper function is neat than the constructor. Just a small function, why I need to call `init_model` from one instance and use the constructor to do it?

```
class test_mock : public dc {
// expose the protected init_model
blah get_init_model() { return init_model(); };

// make the protected constructor public

542841708,"Hi

Im curious if there is any public documentation on CoreML's device selection heuristic. With the addition of 10.15's CoreML preferredMetalDevice API for MLModelConfig, I imagined it would be possible to force the MTLDevice an MLModel / Vision request runs on.

In my testing with integrated, discrete and eGPU, it appears only the eGPU consistently runs the CoreML model. My CoreML Model is a pipeline model consisting of a Mobilenet classifier with multiple outputs (multi head classifiers attached to a custom feature extractor).

Im curious to understand device selection preference for a few reasons:

a) Id like to ensure my MLModel is fed images CIImages backed by textures local to the device inference will be run on, to limit PCI transfers and keep things local

b) my model is actually fed frames of video, and WWDC '19 / 10.15 introduces VideoToolbox and AVFoundation API's to help force particular video encoders and decoders on specific GPUs.

In theory, if all works well, I should be able to specify the same MTLDevice for video decode, preprocessing, CoreML/Vision inference, and subsequent encoding - keeping all IOSurface backed pixel buffers and textures resident on the same GPU.

Apple has a Pro Apps WWDC video suggesting this is the path forward to fast path Multi GPU support / Afterburner decoder support moving forward.

Does CoreML ACTUALLY allow suggested device placement to work?

I am running a retina MacBook Pro 2018 with Vega 20 GPU, and trying various methods to get the Vega 20 to light up.

* Disabling automatic graphics switching
*  Disabling automatic graphics switching / setting NSSupportsAutomaticGraphicsSwitching to False
*  Disabling automatic graphics switching / setting NSSupportsAutomaticGraphicsSwitching to True
*  Enabling automatic graphics switching / setting NSSupportsAutomaticGraphicsSwitching to False
*  Enabling automatic graphics switching / setting NSSupportsAutomaticGraphicsSwitching to True

* having a full battery and plugged into my Apple power adaptor
* having full battery and plugged into my eGPU 

I can only on occasion get the Vega 20 to 'light up' - but can consistently have CoreML run on the eGPU (Radeon 580)

I can inspect the CoreML model and see its MLConfig has a preferred device set to the Vega 20, but Instruments, Xcode, and Activity Monitor all report no GPU usage on the Vega 20, and in fact, sometimes no GPU usage at all (not even the integrated GPU).

Any insight would be most helpful.

Apologies if this is not the best repository to post my query to.

Thanks in advance.

I don't think that needs to go in with this PR anyway. As far as initialization goes, here are my thoughts.

There are three checkpoints re: initialization.

1. **Have the initialization be all zeros and try to get `model.train()` to work with that.**
2.  **Add Xavier initialization with a cold start.**
3. **Add functionality to load the warm start model in C++**

I am curious to learn more about the same and if there is a way to bridge the gap. At the same time, I want you to know we would try our best to ensure MXnet supports all your required platforms (Linux being one of them).

First, I tried incorporating the changes from https://github.com/apple/turicreate/pull/2319 and still got the Segmentation Fault.

I ran [file](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_(command)) on the above image, and got:
```

The image marked as an `8-bit colormap` and not `8-bit/color RGBA`, is interesting.
Preview successfully displays the image and shows RGB with the ""Alpha channel"" box checked, when we look at image info in Preview. 
I also tried to load the image using PIL as follows:
```python
from PIL import Image
image = Image.open('starter.png')
print(image)
# prints: <PIL.PngImagePlugin.PngImageFile image mode=P size=1600x1600 at 0x10619F2B0>

print(image.getpixel((800,800)))
# prints: a single integer, as if it was an 8-bit colormap
# should print: a tuple with four integers, representing the channel values for each of R, G, B, A.

We did some investigation and realized that the Segmentation Fault was coming from decoding the [starter image](https://img.rewe-static.de/0119032/1741150_digital-image.png?resize=1320px:1320px&output-quality=90&output-format=image), so this is actually independent of the One Shot Object Detector.

If you have any of the following:

- Before and after pictures
- The CoreML model

And this may be contributing to your lack of quality.

2. Also, if it‚Äôs okay with you, would you be able to share the ""Stop.png"" image you used so we can try to repro this?

Large Tensor Support
Before MXNet 1.5.0, MXNet supported a maximal tensor size of around 4 billion (2¬≥¬≤). This was due to uint32_t being used as the default data type for tensor size, as well as variable indexing. Now you can enable large tensor support by changing the following build flag to 1: USE_INT64_TENSOR_SIZE = 1.(Note this is set to 0 by default) This enabled large scale training for example large graph network training using Deep Graph Library.

529714671,"Looks like there are two issues here. One is a TuriCreate issue and one is a Poetry issue.

The first issue is that TuriCreate has transistive dependency requirements that can not be satisfied. For one reason or another this has been the case for quite awhile. We are tracking the most recent issue causing it in #2249.

The second issue is a Poetry issue. When constructing an error message for the above issue, Poetry tries to concatenate a `str` and a `int`. This can be seen by running: `poetry add -vvv turicreate` rather than just `poetry add turicreate`.

I suggest you open an issue or pull request with Poetry. Given the stack trace it should be easy to fix.

Please note: that when/if Poetry fixes their issue, you still will not be able to use TuriCreate with Poetry, because Poetry requires all dependencies to be satisfied.

Definitely got 100% prediction probabilities on validation data that was not used in the training set. This was not true for all images, but definitely some. Interestingly, I also saw this behavior with a CoreML2 model I trained using TuriCreate, which I didn't see previously. (I was using v5.4)

Some hypotheses: 

* The model does a great job identifying snakes because they are distinctive, and the 1/0/0/0/0/0 probabilities I'm getting aren't a problem. This happens less frequently with the other classes. 
* Neither model has been finely tuned and so these wonky results aren't particularly concerning
* There _is_ a difference between the underlying neural networks in CoreML2 and CoreML3 that is making it more likely for the image classification model to strongly favor one class in a multi-class problem. Not sure if this is a bug or just something worth understanding better.  After more digging, I'm leaning towards the latter. 

Also potentially of note: I did a software update yesterday for another reason, so I'm now on 10.15 Beta (19A536g). Not sure if that changed anything significant.

Suppose the example validation image you're seeing 1.0 predictions on was in the validation set, which the CreateML model overfit to -- would that explain what you're seeing?

A couple more things that might shed more light on what's going on:

* Try some other random images from the dataset and see what the model reports for them (vs. ground truth).
* Try some images from outside the original dataset (i.e. your own photos, or some from elsewhere).

1. At present, I'm afraid the best way to guard against overfitting is to evaluate the trained model, for different numbers of iterations, against a held-out test set.

Perhaps by just periodically giving the validation performance on a validation set, during training.

522490469,"Yes, I'd think so. Looking at the other requirements there are more dependencies fixed at a specific version (`coremltools`, `prettytable`, `resampy`) which would similarly fail to install along any other library that might fix those same dependencies (or maybe allows only a narrow range).

I'm not familiar with best practices regarding dependencies for libraries, but intuitively it makes sense to bound them according to what functionality your own library actually requires, and let dependencies handle their own bounds. In this concrete case, it should be enough to restrict `numpy` in your requirements to whatever minimum version you need, and let `mxnet` handle further restrictions if they are really not compatible with a more recent version. But like I said, there might be good reasons to handle dependencies differently...",yes think looking fixed specific version would similarly fail install along library might fix maybe narrow range familiar best regarding intuitively sense bound according functionality library actually let handle concrete case enough restrict whatever minimum version need let handle really compatible recent version like said might good handle differently,issue,positive,positive,positive,positive,positive,positive
522165914,"@MarkusShepherd - Thank you for the detailed write up. I appreciate it.

I agree we should do a better job of handling dependency versions. Relying on a range of versions would certainly be better.

Here are all of the distinct requirements for `numpy` in Python 3.6 that you shared:
```
- numpy [required: >=1.14.5, installed: 1.16.4]
- numpy [required: >=1.8.2,<1.15.0, installed: 1.16.4]
- numpy [required: Any, installed: 1.16.4]
- numpy [required: >=1.10, installed: 1.16.4]
- numpy [required: >=1.13.3, installed: 1.16.4]
```
So it sounds like we should change [our numpy requirement](https://github.com/apple/turicreate/blob/ca6b9b02d604e03b9a8aea95b9172d3758286930/src/python/setup.py#L118) from `numpy==1.16.4` to `numpy >=1.14.5, <1.15.0`.

520019381,"# Parameters to help train Style Transfer Models

Hopefully these tips will help you achieve a better result @banoslo. It'll go over the things you could experiment with and modify to iteratively achieve the model you desire.

#### style_loss_mult

The larger the values of the `style_loss_mult`, the more stylized the image 
is. The diagram below illustrates this effect (Note: the model was trained for 
`64,000` iterations.)

![style_loss_computation](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4616962/62800465-52e44e00-ba98-11e9-8874-d8a104fa42db.png)

An example of setting the `style_loss_mult` flag is show below:

```
model = tc.style_transfer.create(styles, content, _advanced_parameters={""style_loss_mult"":[1e-4, 1e-4, 1e-4, 1e-4]})
```

#### finetune_all_params

There are two different approaches to updating parameters in the style transfer 
network.

- Only update the instance normalization layers (`finetune_all_params: False`)
- Update both the convolutional and instance normalization layers. (`finetune_all_params: True`)

An example of setting the `finetune_all_params` flag is show below:

```
model = tc.style_transfer.create(styles, content, _advanced_parameters={""finetune_all_params"":False})
```

##### finetune_all_params = False

**Pros**

- Trains quicker because there are less parameters to train.
- When training a model with multiple styles, the network usually converges, though the quality may suffer as a side-effect.

**Cons**

- Pre-trained weights must be used or the model doesn‚Äôt converge.
- Really limited by the convolutonal weights, the model might not be able to train past artifacts due to the low number of updatable parameters.

##### finetune_all_params = True

**Pros**

- Can converge without pre-trained weights.
- Usually leads to a model with a higher stylization quality.
- Increasing the number of iterations usually decreases the atrifacts present in the stylization.

**Cons**

- Requires a larger number of iterations to converge.
- When training a model with multiple styles, the network may never converge.

#### pretrained_weights

This option allows for the loading of pre-trained weights from a model trained 
with `32` distinct style images. For some styles, pre-trained weights can act 
as a warm-start for the training; for other styles these weights can by a 
hinderance, potentially introducting artifacts when stylizing images. As 
convergence is heavily determined by the style images chosen, further user 
experimentation is required.


When `finetune_all_params` is `False`, `pretrained_weights` is required to be 
`True` else the model won't converge.

An example of setting the `pretrained_weights` flag is show below:

```
model = tc.style_transfer.create(styles, content, _advanced_parameters={""pretrained_weights"":True})
```

See [how-it-works](https://github.com/apple/turicreate/blob/master/userguide/style_transfer/how-it-works.md) for the paper from which these weights were procured.

#### Checkpointing

To assist with the qualatative nature of training the style transfer network, a 
checkpointing feature is exposed in the advanced parameters section. Rather than
create multiple training loops for training models with different iterations, 
simply set the `checkpoint` flag to true and a turicreate model is saved with 
the prefix specified by `checkpoint_prefix` parameter every nth iteration which 
is specified by the `checkpoint_increment` parameter.

An example of using the checkpointing feature is show below:

```
model = tc.style_transfer.create(styles, content, _advanced_parameters={""checkpoint"":True, ""checkpoint_prefix"":""./awesome-model"", ""checkpoint_increment"":100})
```

I checked the original paper and found:

We used the same network architecture as in Johnson et al. (2016), 
except for two key details:
zero-padding is replaced with mirror-padding, and transposed convolutions (also sometimes called
deconvolutions) are replaced with nearest-neighbor upsampling followed by a convolution. The
use of mirror-padding avoids border patterns sometimes caused by zero-padding in SAME-padded
convolutions, **while the replacement for transposed convolutions avoids checkerboard patterning**, as
discussed in Odena et al. (2016). 

This model seems to be built like the  tensorflow/magenta equivalent
Adding the padding was done in 5.5
Avoiding the checkerboard patterning seems to be the way to go. 
Can you put it on 5.8?

519677691,"Hi nickjing, thanks for fast response. and yes your answers helped me already much. Following 3 more questions, would be much appreciated if you can answer to it too :)

1) it's possible to indicate a overfitting with the loss value? Or only if i evaluate the model after training with data that never seen before and create a table where i write down the average / iterations and see if the performance goes down with more iterations and not more up?

3) I guess your answer for no. 4 was more related to my question no. 3 of correct ""Data preparation""
The user guide described how create from dataset ""IG02"" annotations. Data IG02 is rich annotated, because it has masks and occlusions. So my questions is: _understand turicreate occlusion?_ If i want that the model recognize a ""full"" person (with legs, that are behind something) so how i have annotate this? First the Person and where i think the legs/foots end and than a box over the part of the desk/bar and give them ""no person"" label? 
But what if i have 2-3 persons, and one is behind the other one. First person is 100% visible, and the person behind only for 50% visible. Is in this case following annotation the correct one?
![person_behind_person](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8724611/62735554-bab07f80-ba2b-11e9-9c0e-d06abb37614c.png)


4) sorry i mixed up here something between ""transfer learning"" and ""weights"", my questions was more like, ""it's possible to download yolo pretrained weights and integrate it to my model with my own data."" (so that i don't need train again the model for ""chairs, desks, cups and so one"". and just can add my trained class to the already trained classes?)

519659394,"Let me take a pass at some of your questions!

1. The loss reported in the progress table is the ""YOLO"" loss defined in the model/algorithm described in our user guide here: https://apple.github.io/turicreate/docs/userguide/object_detection/how-it-works.html It's essentially a measure of the distance/discrepancy between what the model is currently predicting and the labeled ground truth. The smallest possible loss is 0, corresponding to predictions that exactly match the labeled data. Overfitting is certainly a potential issue. Right now, what you can do is try running the model for different numbers of iterations and comparing the resulting validation metrics on a held-out set of data. One thing we're thinking about now is how to make it easier to reason about checkpointing / early stopping to streamline this process.
2. Yes, our object detection toolkit uses transfer learning as well, in a different fashion than image classification. That toolkit relies on a fixed model to extract features from each image; the learning is done in the space of those extracted features. For object detection, we initialize a network with an existing (pre-trained) model, then tune that to fit your data.
3. I don't think you can have too much data, but yes, I think in practice it's correct to be thinking now about data quality. Ideally you want your training data to represent the use cases where the model will be deployed, so if it's going to be deployed in rooms with different floors, collecting data from different rooms could be a good idea. Manually editing the data to change out the floors should work too, if that's actually less work. (It'd be a kind of manual data augmentation.)
4. Not sure I understand your question, but in practice I would recommend just labeling the things you care about. The model should automatically learn to ignore anything you didn't label. It's perfectly reasonable to have only one class label (e.g. ""person""), since you are implicitly labeling everything outside your annotated bounding boxes as ""not a person"".
5. Sorry, I can't offer specific recommendations or endorsements.

Hope that helps!",let take pas loss progress table loss defined user guide essentially measure model currently ground truth possible loss corresponding exactly match data certainly potential issue right try running model different resulting validation metric set data one thing thinking make easier reason early stopping streamline process yes object detection transfer learning well different fashion image classification fixed model extract image learning done space extracted object detection initialize network model tune fit data think much data yes think practice correct thinking data quality ideally want training data represent use model going different data different could good idea manually data change work actually le work kind manual data augmentation sure understand question practice would recommend care model automatically learn ignore anything label perfectly reasonable one class label person since implicitly everything outside bounding person sorry ca offer specific hope,issue,positive,positive,positive,positive,positive,positive

You should only have one of these packages installed.

I would try CUDA 9 and uninstall the other version. Run `pip uninstall mxnet-cu100 mxnet-cu90` and see if that works.",support currently deep learning latest version work first version support need would work support like several different version post one would try version run pip see work,issue,positive,positive,positive,positive,positive,positive

You could read the file pointed to by tc.config.get_server_log_location().  However, better logging is something that we're working on.

504758228,"@mecid Yes, so, here are some steps to work around the issue:

First you have to tell Xcode not to compile the .mlmodel but still package with Xcode app bundle. Here are the steps:

1. Drag and drop your ""UpdatableSleepClassifier.mlmodel"" into your Xcode project.
2. Click on the project (in left panel) and then on your target. 
3. Go to ""Build Phases"" and click on the + sign on top left in that screen.
4. Click on ""New Copy File Phase"" -> new phase appears with name (Copy Files).
5. Open the new phase and add your ""UpdatableSleepClassifier.mlmodel"" into that.
6. Open up ""Compile Sources"" phase (2nd from top) and remove ""UpdatableSleepClassifier.mlmodel"".

Next, you'll have to compile this .mlmodel to create .mlmodelc and use that to create an instance of MLModel on the device. Here's some quick code snippet I hacked up just now that you could use to do that although, you should re-work this for production.

```
let updatableModelURL = URL(fileURLWithPath: Bundle.main.path(forResource: ""UpdatableSleepClassifier"", ofType: ""mlmodel"")!)
let tmpLocation = URL(fileURLWithPath: NSTemporaryDirectory()).appendingPathComponent(""UpdatableSleepClassifier.mlmodel"")
        
try? FileManager.default.copyItem(at: updatableModelURL, to: tmpLocation)
        
do {
    let compiledModelURL = try MLModel.compileModel(at: tmpLocation)
    let model = try MLModel(contentsOf: compiledModelURL)
} catch {
    print(""Failed with \(error)"")
    return
}
```

503407052,"Hey @dogahe, 

Using the item content recommender is admittedly a bit tricky.  I'm not really happy with it's overall performance and the amount of general tweaking required to get it working, and I wrote it. 

Currently, the method uses a bunch of heuristics to build a graph of what items are similar to which other items.   The distance between two items is a weight of the distances between the individual columns of the items, with the weights determined by another heuristic -- essentially the distances are weighted so that average weighted distance between all column pairs equals 1, i.e. all columns have approximately equal weight.  I'm not sure how to get these base weights, but you can supply additional weights to scale each column if you want.  Ideally, these weights should be learned, but that's not a feature we've implemented yet. 

2 is a bug.  

So, given your use case, I would recommend a bit more detailed of a process.  The same process as the item_content_recommender does under the hood (See https://github.com/apple/turicreate/blob/master/src/unity/python/turicreate/toolkits/recommender/item_content_recommender.py) can be done explicitly with the nearest neighbors toolkit, and that can be used to create a graph of item similarities by querying the model with the same data used to build it.  With that, that graph can be passed into the item_similarity_recommender using the nearest_items parameter, in which case the user -item table can just be an empty SFrame with the appropriately named columns.  This can then essentially replicate the entire item_content recommender, but give you much more control over the task.

503406083,Ok all right thanks. Also I have been trying to train my machine learning models on the could using intel AI devcloud but I can't figure out how. Can you look into it? Training on my Mac takes forever because I have an integrated gpu!,right thanks also trying train machine learning could ai ca figure look training mac forever,issue,negative,positive,positive,positive,positive,positive

Dear Toby
I figured it out.
As you are a much more experienced ml expert than I, you always knew the answer.
The better questions are:
Why is there only a basic documentation of tc?
Why is tc not developing more?
I can see createml is the main dev effort, but serving more models and parametric options can be a way
for tc to be more important - in the meanwhile tc more and more seems to be a playground.
I only made experiences with your yolo model and the style transfer model.
For the yolo model, there is good news in createml.
I am currently trying out style transfer models and I see that the is so much development in this area,
It's not easy to see why the transfer results are not as good as single model results in tf, but I like the possibility of calculating several styles into one model.
vgg19 with cocotrain images can produce quite nice tf models.
And so on.....
Hope the tc team will not only do bugfixing in the future.

Why am I not submitting a pull request for documentation?
Hmm. Maybe because the pros should have done it.",dear toby figured much experienced expert always knew answer better basic documentation see main dev effort serving parametric way important meanwhile playground made model style transfer model model good news currently trying style transfer see much development area easy see transfer good single model like possibility calculating several one model produce quite nice hope team future pull request documentation maybe done,issue,positive,positive,positive,positive,positive,positive

498726192,"Hello @benjaminbraunberkeley,

Thanks for your interest in this!  I'm happy to provide you with some guidance if you want to dig into this more.  I don't think we'll be implementing this, but you're welcome to play around with it.  The sampling code is in the choose_negative_example method of src/unity/toolkits/factorization/ranking_sgd_solver_base.hpp.  

The challenge with weighted sampling strategies is that there are a lot of side effects that are not immediately intuitive here. The negative sampling works more as a regularizer on the solution than as an objective to maximize the difference between the positive and negative examples.  The real objective is to end up with a solution such that the predicted scores of the negative items -- those that the negative sampling suppresses -- are actually ranked according to the users preferences.  In other words, the question to ask is actually ""Which unobserved items are most resistant to being suppressed?""  This question then leads us to assume that the sampling should be effectively exchangeable or uniform.  Thus, if you target ones that are the most ""sensible"" to suppress, you may decrease their predictive score while, as a side effect, you increase the predicted score of less desirable user-item pairs.  

Looking at the paper you mentioned, I'm quite skeptical.  First, it's relatively expensive to do their sampling - while theirs converges faster per iteration, each iteration is substantially more expensive than MF-BPR.    One could do 20-30 iterations of the MF-BPR method in one iteration of PRFM.  (See Figure 3 vs. Figure 4).

It's quite reasonable for somebody to try training models varying only the batch size, to evaluate the effect on model quality.

490673398,"Hi @fbomb111 ,

I don't think it's possible to pip install a git repository. You could, however, clone from master, build from source, and then work with Turi Create built from source. [Here](https://github.com/apple/turicreate/blob/master/BUILD.md) are the steps to make that happen.

This fix will become available in our next release, which will be in a few weeks. If you don't want to wait for the next release, here is a workaround code snippet to help you convert all the grayscale images in your SFrame to RGB so you can then visualize bounding boxes on them:

```python
import turicreate as tc
import numpy as np

def gray2rgb(image):
    # grayscale tc.Image -> RGB tc.Image
    if image.channels == 1:
        rgb_pixel_data = image.pixel_data[..., np.newaxis]
        image_rgb =  np.concatenate(3 * (rgb_pixel_data,), axis=-1)
        FORMAT_RAW = 2
        return tc.Image(_image_data=image_rgb.tobytes(),
                        _width=image_rgb.shape[1],
                        _height=image_rgb.shape[0],
                        _channels=image_rgb.shape[2],
                        _format_enum=FORMAT_RAW,
                        _image_data_size=image_rgb.size)

# Note: replace sf, ""image"", and ""annotation""
sf[""converted_image""] = sf[""image""].apply(gray2rgb)

sf[""bbox""] = tc.object_detector.util.draw_bounding_boxes(sf[""converted_image""], sf[""annotation""])

489717759,"Hi @fbomb111 ,

Thanks for using and providing great feedback on the Turi Create Object Detector. We created an issue tracking making `draw_bounding_boxes` provide more helpful debugging information (#1838 ).

Regarding the error you get, let's confirm that this is the image that `draw_bounding_boxes` failed on. I downloaded the image and ran `draw_bounding_boxes` on just that image and the annotation you provided and I saw bounding boxes (see attachment). There could be a few possibilities:
- There is a bad image in your SFrame (probably the one you attached).
- There is no bad image in your SFrame and there's a bad codepath that gets triggered either on a particular image or on the SFrame as a whole.

Could you run the following code snippet (replace `sf`, `image_column_name`, and `annotation_column_name`) to see if this still points to the same image you attached?

```
for row in sf.num_rows():
    image = sf[image_column_name][row]
    annotation = sf[annotation_column_name][row]
    try:
        tc.object_detector.util.draw_bounding_boxes(image, annotation)
    except:
        print(""Bad image row number:"")
        print(row)
        print(""Bad image"")
        image.show()
``` 

Let us know what you get when you run this!

482733439,"Hey @benjaminbraunberkeley, 

The models with side features have one problem which impacts training.  The reason for this is often due to thread contention on the side features -- multiple sgd updates may clobber each other with the side features, which sometimes causes these models to diverge.  Numeric side features are the worst offenders.  When we designed this algorithm, we considered putting locks around these updates, but in many cases that would have significantly slowed down the training so we did not do that.   

Also, running in single threaded mode would provide a test for this -- this can be done by starting your code with setting the environment variable OMP_NUM_THREADS=""1"". 

The best way we've found to avoid this scenario is to instead use a large number of categorical features instead of numerical ones.  For example, binning a single numeric feature into the 100 quantiles would help this.  Also, not having side factorization terms but lots of categories may give a good result as well. 

Negative examples are sampled from all the user / item pairs that showed no interaction.  Any user/item side features are attached to those, and the optimization is performed on those.  The sampling strategy, as well as the loss associate with them, follows this paper: https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2484126.   Essentially, with a positive user/item data point, it samples a number of items not rated by that user, chooses the item that has the largest value, then does an SGD step on the pair attempting to increase the predicted value of the positive example and decrease the value of the negative example.  Generally we found that more samples give a more stable and better result. 

The Approx. Training Predictive Error is calculated based on the accumulated predictive error of each sample immediately before the SGD descent is provided.  This tracks the true loss quite well. 

There is no way currently to stop after an absolute loss value -- that's a good feature request, though.  You might be able to get by with adjusting the threshold of subsequent loss decrease defined for convergence -- when the loss stops decreasing above a certain rate, the model is assumed to have converged; this is adjustable.

Hope that helps!
-- Hoyt

480457999,"After looking at the code I believe I've identified the issue. I'm able to reproduce this problem myself. It doesn't have anything to do with using the directory to get labels. Your code for that looks good to me.

In order for the sound classifier to use an audio clip it basically needs to be at least a second long (well 975 milliseconds to be precise). Unfortunately there is a bug in what the sound classifier does when it's asked to make a prediction for a clip which is too short. It's silently dropping it. So if you pass in an SFrame for ten wav files but one of them isn't long enough, you only get nine predictions out. This is a bug.

To answer your second question: we can currently only read wav files. So the only limitations should be that it needs to be a wav file which is at least 975 milliseconds long.

As a temporary work around, please try filtering out audio clicks that are less than 975 milliseconds. This can be done using the following code right before your train/test split:
```python
def is_at_least_min_length(audio_dict):
     num_samples = len(audio_dict['data'])
     audio_length = num_samples / float(audio_dict['sample_rate'])
     return audio_length > .975

data['is_long_enought'] = data['audio'].apply(is_at_least_min_length)
data = data.filter_by([1], 'is_long_enought')

Also, can it be that the normalization happens also for categorical variables (which values are only 0 and 1)? In this case, there would be many more multiplications in the sum, as all of the xis would be non zero.

In the ViewController where one sets the exifOrientation, one has to set the orientation for portrait mode to .right:
        case UIDeviceOrientation.portrait:            // Device oriented vertically, home button on the bottom
            exifOrientation = .right

477702235,"@philimanjaro thank you so much for your detailed information on how you solved this. I also annotated images in original image size and managed to crash Mac while running Turi training on 300 images. So I resized the images, moved over from annotating on Via to RectLabel (which directly supports Turi Crete export!).

Although annotation rectangles showed up in the same exact place after image resize, the underlying annotated rectangle coordinates were from the original image dimensions. So I had to basically change something in each photo (label, the position of the rectangle, etc) for RectLabel to save the new coords.

Hopefully, this is a useful resource for the future reader of this thread:

@adincebic We just released Turi Create 5.4, which now contains a new annotation API for image classification. Please try it out and let us know what you think! It's `turicreate.image_classifier.annotate`:

```
Annotate your images loaded in either an SFrame or SArray Format

The annotate util is a GUI assisted application used to create labels in
SArray Image data. Specifying a column, with dtype Image, in an SFrame
works as well since SFrames are composed of multiple SArrays.

When the GUI is terminated an SFrame is returned with the representative,
images and annotations.

The returned SFrame includes the newly created annotations.

Parameters
--------------
data : SArray | SFrame
    The data containing the images. If the data type is 'SArray'
    the 'image_column', and 'annotation_column' variables are used to construct
    a new 'SFrame' containing the 'SArray' data for annotation.
    If the data type is 'SFrame' the 'image_column', and 'annotation_column'
    variables are used to annotate the images.

image_column: string, optional
    If the data type is SFrame and the 'image_column' parameter is specified
    then the column name is used as the image column used in the annotation. If
    the data type is 'SFrame' and the 'image_column' variable is left empty. A
    default column value of 'image' is used in the annotation. If the data type is
    'SArray', the 'image_column' is used to construct the 'SFrame' data for
    the annotation

annotation_column : string, optional
    If the data type is SFrame and the 'annotation_column' parameter is specified
    then the column name is used as the annotation column used in the annotation. If
    the data type is 'SFrame' and the 'annotation_column' variable is left empty. A
    default column value of 'annotation' is used in the annotation. If the data type is
    'SArray', the 'annotation_column' is used to construct the 'SFrame' data for
    the annotation


Returns
-------

out : SFrame
    A new SFrame that contains the newly annotated data.

            For more details regarding name generation, missing value handling and
            other, refer to the SArray version of
            :py:func:`~turicreate.SArray.unpack()`.
    
            Parameters
            ----------
            column_name : str, optional
                Name of the unpacked column, if provided. If not provided
                and only one column is present then the column is unpacked.
                In case of multiple columns, name must be provided to know
                which column to be unpacked.
    
    
            column_name_prefix : str, optional
                If provided, unpacked column names would start with the given
                prefix. If not provided, default value is the name of the unpacked
                column.
    
            column_types : [type], optional
                Column types for the unpacked columns.
                If not provided, column types are automatically inferred from first
                100 rows. For array type, default column types are float.  If
                provided, column_types also restricts how many columns to unpack.
    
            na_value : flexible_type, optional
                If provided, convert all values that are equal to ""na_value"" to
                missing value (None).
    
            limit : list[str] | list[int], optional
                Control unpacking only a subset of list/array/dict value. For
                dictionary SArray, `limit` is a list of dictionary keys to restrict.
                For list/array SArray, `limit` is a list of integers that are
                indexes into the list/array value.
    
            Returns
            -------
            out : SFrame
                A new SFrame that contains rest of columns from original SFrame with
                the given column replaced with a collection of unpacked columns.

Sure.  I just want to be able to train a model using audio files (e.g. .wav).

462128818,"Hi @Umity,

I am a complete newby in the Style Transfer matter and came across the same issues. 
The main two problems in my case where the number of iterations and the style loss multipliers.
I wrote a short article on my test results [here](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/style-transfer-neural-network-josef-grunig/); maybe it helps.

Regarding the banding issue #666 it gets less visible by raising number of iterations.
The reason I opened this thread was exactly for asking a more detailed explanations of those low level parameters that can definitely help in getting better result. 

I suggest also reading the paper this algorithm comes from [A Learned Representation For Artistic Style](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1610.07629.pdf), where those parameters are used.

If you build master then you'll be able to use your new functionality today.

```git clone ""https://github.com/apple/turicreate.git""```
2) Change into the turicreate directory

```./configure```
4) Once configured change directories again into:
```cd ./debug/src/unity```
5) Then run the make command
```make -j4```
6) Change directories back into the root directory
```cd ../../..```
7) Set up your python environment with the new turicreate you just built

The main reason we do not currently support the export_coreml method for the factorization recommender is that that model, unlike the item similarity model, packages the data of all users along with the item data and only really makes predictions for users seen at recommendation time, which ends up limiting its usefulness in apps.

> > How are you building your project?

I'm not sure what the issue is.  Currently, our libraries are < 30MB.  The 88MB for the linux tarball comes because we have to statically link in a number of dependent libraries to get it to run reliably on linux.  If you compile it locally, you won't have this issue.  

There are ways in our build to separate out specific components if you are building the C-API, or other connectors, but it's not in our scope to do this at the python layer.  

>

> I'm not sure that I understand right what you mean, but if you wonder, what the preferred way to build the lib for me is, it is CMake + ninja (with some customizations done using CMakeCache, I usually set `CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release` (causes -O3), add `-mtune=native`, experiment with `-march=native` and usually enable the latest c++ version to be used (this may result in better performance because of move semantics in stdlib containers and constexprs) ), and after that I call `setup.py bdist_wheel`, which should discover the lib prebuilt with CMake and create a wheel. Then I open the wheel with an archiver and add there some needed libs (I use the latest MinGW-w64 and I don't put MinGW installation dir into PATH because it would cause a conflict with Octave, using some ancient version).

In our case, we have a lot of custom build processes, and we've had an emphasis on benchmarked speed throughout.  You are welcome to play around with alternate ways of building it.  I'd encourage you to check out the BUILD.md in the base, which gives you detailed build instructions. 

> 
> If a lib uses other libs, I prefer downloading prebuilt dependencies from a trustworthy enough source (for example Fedora project distributes some libs, like Boost, prebuilt with MinGW-w64) over rebuilding them myself.

In our cases, due to a combination of issues -- bugfix patches, compilation flags, etc., All our c++ dependencies are compiled from source as part of the build process.

452947135,"Thanks for opening issues to address the questions I posted.

As of now, what parameters for the image classifier can I use? I know max_iterations works, anything else?

Is the problem with the linear regression giving the error caused by how I wrote my code? I used a direct path to my dataset of image files, while in your code (which worked), you saved the dataset as an sframe. Could this be the underlying factor?

Also, is what you mentioned about linear regressions not being accurate also true about logistic regression? (I would like to use the class_weights = auto function in order to balance my unbalanced data.)

How long do you think it will take to implement the feature request?

One more concern, in the online GitBook for Turi Create, under the image classifier page, there is a link for ""accessing attributes of the model"" which takes you to the linear regression page? This is what I originally clicked that brought me to this question. Maybe the documentation should be edited to make the fact that linear regression parameters can't be used on image classifier more clear.

Sorry for all the questions, and thanks again!

**Edit:** It looks like whenever a png file is among the group of images, the `libpng` warning is output. If the images are all jpg files, no such warning appears. 

Also, when I test just one subdirectory at a time, I get this response:

This shows that the images are at least being processed.

**Edit 2:** After some experimentation, it seems that that if I include only small groups of jpg files, the Turi visualization opens and functions as it should. (If I try 200 jpg files, the Turi visualization fails.) Also, when I include a png file, it doesn't open and I get this error:

The problem may lie with the png files.

# print ""Hello"" <- works
# 4. Create the model
model = tc.image_classifier.create(data, target=""label"") # <- When model is created using train_data (recommended), segfault. When data is used, lambda error.

# 5. Save predictions to an SArray
predictions = model.predict(test_data)

# 6. Evaluate the model and save the results into a dictionary

Taking another look at the output you shared, it looks like you have 113,404 classes but only 123,481 examples. That's is less than 1.09 examples on average per class. It is very difficult for a model to correctly predict a class, if it only has a small number of examples for that class. Having a large number of classes also increases training time. 

I recommend you explore how often classes appear in your dataset. You probably want to remove examples from your training data if their classes only appear a small number of times.

442220160,"@nuthinking, I'm assuming you're talking about the CoreML export for the style transfer model based on your question about `CIImages`. There may have been some confusion here. **You can actually input any shape that you want into the network!**

You're probably looking at:

https://apple.github.io/turicreate/docs/userguide/style_transfer/export-coreml.html

On this page you'll see: 
```swift
let modelInputSize = CGSize(width: 600, height: 600)
```

This is actually not a default size. It's a size that's defined by the user. You can change that!

**Note**: we do support a notion of `flexible_shape` in the CoreML export, so we'll be able to take any image size as an input. However, if this isn't supported on your version of MacOS (You'd get an error in XCode if it wasn't), or you'd like to explicitly set an export shape, here's how to do it:

The default CoreML export size is in-fact 256x256, as you'll see in the doc-string

```python
'''
image_shape: tuple
            A tuple (defaults to (256, 256)) will bind the CoreML model to a fixed shape.
'''
```
So in your export code, just do the following (note the `image_shape` parameter):

```python
model.export_coreml('MyStyleTransfer.mlmodel', image_shape=(2048, 2048))
```

Hope that helps, if you have any further questions I'd be more than happy to help!

442196504,"Hi @TobyRoseman thanks a lot for your response, I'll definitely try that out tomorrow. Do you think that this would impact the probabilities a lot on the objects it knows? 

And I was also wondering if it would matter if I would train one object with let's say 800 images, and another one with 300. Would the model be more likely to favour the one with the 800 images over the one with the 300 in the list of probabilities? (Basically, would I still be able to get 99% probability if it's actually pointing at the object with the 300 image item as easy as I would with the object that was trained with 800 images?)

And one last question, I've also trained some models using TensorFlow, I did use other pre-trained models. But the probabilities I get from these models are lower in general with the exact same dataset. TuriCreate sometimes even hits 100%, where as with TensorFlow 90% would be considered very high. I also seemed to get less high scores on objects such as roofs and floors etc. The problem I have with TensorFlow though is that the results just aren't as good as TuriCreate when pointing at the actual object. TuriCreate always seems to recognize it, where TensorFlow (using MobileNet as pre-trained model) just isn't as accurate. Is there a reason why TensorFlow and TuriCreate are giving so much different results with the exact same dataset? Is it just because of the pre-trained model I picked?",hi thanks lot response definitely try tomorrow think would impact lot also wondering would matter would train one object let say another one would model likely one one list basically would still able get probability actually pointing object image item easy would object trained one last question also trained use get lower general exact sometimes even would considered high also get le high problem though good pointing actual object always recognize model accurate reason giving much different exact model picked,issue,positive,positive,positive,positive,positive,positive
442190341,"Hi @jordy-wijman -

I think this is a very common issue with a lot of machine learning algorithms. Machine learning models are often over confident when give randomly generated examples or even just examples from categories outside of their training set. 

One thing you could try is to create another class in your training data called ""other"". Put lots of randomly picked images in that class. Or if walls and floors are common false positives for your case, put images of walls and floors in your class. Then hopefully when your model sees something which is not one of the five objects you care about, it will classify it as ""other"".

Hope this helps. Let us know if you have any additional questions. If you try my suggestion, let us know how it works.",hi think common issue lot machine learning machine learning often confident give randomly even outside training set one thing could try create another class training data put lot randomly picked class common false case put class hopefully model something one five care hope let u know additional try suggestion let u know work,issue,positive,negative,negative,negative,negative,negative

441434755,"Hey Yash,

Thanks for using Turi Create! I think you're running into this issue because you are trying to create an SFrame with a column called ""image"" that has a string (or a list of characters) as the contents. You're probably getting an SFrame with a single column called ""image"" that has each character of the string `'/Users/yasnara/Desktop/images_new_new'` as the elements of that column, i.e. an SFrame with a single column with a dtype of `char`. 

Note that when initializing an SFrame with a dictionary, the keys must be strings that would become column names, **the values must be SArrays corresponding to the columns with the respective column names**, and the length of all the SArrays (columns) must be the same. 

Thus, assuming the SArray with all the images is saved at `'/Users/yasnara/Desktop/images_new_new'`, you want to do the following: 

```
images_sarray_path = '/Users/yasnara/Desktop/images_new_new'
test = tc.SFrame({'image': tc.SArray(images_sarray_path)})
```

More on the SArray API documentation [here](https://apple.github.io/turicreate/docs/api/generated/turicreate.SArray.html).

Thanks for the reply. I have installed several times of Ubuntu and repeated the procedure. Suddenly, I just succeed to use GPU to train the model. I still don't know what's the reason for that.  Here is what I learned and hope it could help someone who might have the same problem.

1. Remove all the installed CUDA before you want to do it again. Follow the procedure to install the Nvidia driver, CUDA and cuDNN, like in here: [https://gist.github.com/zhanwenchen/e520767a409325d9961072f666815bb8]
(There might be some tiny errors to install the Nvidia driver, but the procedure is correct.)
 Check every steps:
Nvidia driver: nvidia-smi,
CUDA: nvcc --version
cuDNN: cat /usr/local/cuda/include/cudnn.h | grep CUDNN_MAJOR -A 2

2. For the mxnet, check all the installed mxnet and uninstall them. The competition between different version of mxnet might cause problems. Then only install the mxnet-cu90.

Funnily enough, I still have the numpy issue.  Going to see about solving that, but it doesn't seem to be a related problem.

I tried an older version (1.12.1) of numpy (mxnet-cu80 1.1.0 says to use numpy <= 1.13.3), but still get similar:

So funnily enough, after a restart (and perhaps, unfortunately, other undocumented prodding), it is actually now running, but crashing.  I think you're right that there was something in the path or oherwise virtual environment that just hadn't gotten updated.

And that's with numpy-1.13.3.  Weird that it's incompatible/home/gilles/.conda/envs/venv/bin/pip
, as mxnet-cu90-1.1.0 says 'has requirement numpy<=1.13.3'.  Doing that latest (1.15.4) version of numpy throws the same error... so not sure there.

And I'm not sure if the numpy error is relevant to the crash but I don't think it is.

So in the mxtest.py script, I had it print the number of GPUs available (`print(mx.test_utils.list_gpus())`), and it gives an answer of [0].

So I think the crash is because mxnet is not finding a GPU to run on, strangely.

Looking into this a bit more, the only real hit I could find is that mxnet + turicreate + CUDA 9.+ is broken:
[https://medium.com/@nickzamosenchuk/training-the-model-for-ios-coreml-in-google-colab-60-times-faster-6b3d1669fc46](url)

So at this point I'm going to try CUDA 8 and and cuDNN 5, instead of the CUDA 9 and cuDNN 7 that I have installed now.

Thoughts?

Thanks again!

And here's the basic little mxtest script:
```
import mxnet as mx

print(mx.test_utils.list_gpus())

a = mx.nd.ones((2, 3), mx.gpu())
b = a * 2 + 1

print(b.asnumpy())

print('Done')

```

437514596,"Hi @iMerica, 

Thank you for the detailed suggestions.  We'll work on incorporating them; some of these are already on our roadmap.  Currently, Turi Create runs and is tested on many production servers, clusters, and other environments, so we're happy to help remove any roadblocks in getting it working nicely in your environment. 

In reading through your post, here are a few things that may be helpful: 

First, the list of dictionary styles is supported using the unpack() function.  Lists correspond to the columns as represented by the SArray type, and SFrames are collections of columns, so to convert from the list of dictionaries, use `unpack()` to change that format to a column-based SFrame: 

```
In [3]: tc.SArray([{""a"" : 1, ""b"" : 2}, {""a"" : 3, ""b"" : 4}]).unpack("""")
Out[3]:
Columns:
	a	int
	b	int

Rows: 2

Data:
+---+---+
| a | b |
+---+---+
| 1 | 2 |
| 3 | 4 |
+---+---+
[2 rows x 2 columns]
```
(Also, the JSON format is an arbitrary mix of lists, dictionaries, numbers, strings, etc., and if this example were given as a string, it would be valid JSON.)

Second, the recommender, classifier, and many other models do accept native types -- lists or dictionaries -- for the predict/recommend functions.  It's quite possible, though, that we've missed some.  What methods are you using that don't behave well with the native types?  

Third, for running TC in server environments, any file paths specified can be s3 (read/write) or http/https (read only) urls.  It's true that the examples assume local disk access, but they can be replaced by s3 or http paths, so `read_csv(""s3://..."")` should work fine.  

If you have images represented by a list of URLs, then you can call 

```
X[""images""] = X[""URL""].apply(tc.Image)
```

to get the data in the right format.   I filed another feature request to make this work automatically with the image classifier.  

Fourth, for the `__str__` and `__repr__` representations, what format would you find more pythonic?  The printing of native types like list, dict, or array is insanely verbose in this context, so when calling `print(X)`, we truncate it to only show the first 10 rows or so.  Note that if you have specific needs for your logging, you can simply replace these methods at runtime, e.g.:  

```
In [15]: def custom_repr(self):
    ...:     return ""SFrame("" + "","".join(self.column_names()) + "")""

In [16]: tc.SFrame.__repr__ = custom_repr

In [17]: tc.SFrame({""a"" : [1, 2, 3]} )
Out[17]: SFrame(a)
```

Finally, for the CoreML model export, you should be able to export the coreml path to a buffer.  I filed a new issue to make sure we do that.  In the meantime, you can work around this with: 

```
import tempfile
with tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile(mode='rw', suffix = '.mlmodel') as mlmodel_file:
    model.export_coreml(mlmodel_file.name)
    data = mlmodel_file.read()
``` 

Thanks!

In that case, the items are selected deterministically based on the indexing of the items, which is fixed at train time; however, due to parallelism that indexing is essentially random.  In other words, the only guarantee is that subsequent calls to predict have the same ordering.  

If you want it to be random between calls, try playing with a small but non-zero value of the diversity parameter; this invokes sampling of the recommendations based on a a balance of diversity (trying to not recommend two items that are nearly identical) with recommendation accuracy, and a small value of the diversity parameter means that recommendation accuracy is pretty much all that's used there.

435472142,"@dogahe The privacy concern is mostly around the app data containing the information for other users than the current user. While it's not straightforward for a typical user to do, a malicious actor could in theory extract information from the app once it's downloaded from the App Store, and if that includes a model that includes user data, they could get access to that user data. (Whereas while you are developing your model, it stays on your machine(s) and isn't downloaded to anyone else.) When a model is queryable by user ID, it necessarily contains the interaction data for the users whose IDs it can be queried for, and we don't expect most app developers would be comfortable shipping that data anywhere.

435452387,"Hello @thanasisDr,

After all the similarities have been computed, a sparse item-to-item lookup table is built that holds, for each item, a list of the most similar items as determined by overlapping content.  All the items are considered, but only the top max_item_neighborhood_size are actually saved and used for prediction.  However, all are considered when building the model.

Note also that by default, the item content recommender doesn't include user access patterns in its recommendations, only the content provided with the items.  To add in user interaction patterns, add a column containing a sparse dictionary of the users interacting with each item as an item feature.   (There are several ways to get the data in for this; e.g. use groupby + concat if you have a table of user-item interactions).

And if I use this model in my iOS app and the only call within that iOS app is to get product recommendations for the current identified and authorized user, I am not sure how the users of my app can have access to my code and my mlmodel to be able to misuse it, i.e., pass other user's ID to get other user's recommendations.

Thank you for your prompt reply. Unfortunately the documentation doesn't reply to my question. The formulas in API do not include anywhere the informatin about the max item neighboorhood. The documentation and the formulas mentioned in it say that for each candidate item the system uses the similarities between that items and all the items the user has rated. If that is the case could you tell me where the max_item_neighborhood_size parameter is used and why it affects the accuracy of the system? I believe that the formula is not correct and a correction or clarification is needed. The parameter I mention is included only in the item content similarity and not in the item similarity recommender. 

I am looking forward to your response. It is very important to know if the system considers all the rated items or some of them defined by the neighboorhood parameter.

435171757,"Hi @dogahe, the reason the model in CoreML only supports interactions and not users for querying is that we typically don't want each user to get access to the interaction history of all users. If the model were to allow for querying by user ID, since it's the same model for all users, any user could in theory query for any other user's recommendations without knowing their interaction history (or even open up the model file and examine other users' interaction history directly, if they have access to it). As the model developer in Turi Create, this doesn't expose any information it shouldn't (since you are starting with the data comprised of interaction history for all users anyway), but for privacy reasons we don't expect that such a database should be given to all the users of your app.

Presumably the use case for an on-device recommender model is to get recommendations for the current user (not necessarily any other user). And our assumption is that for the current user, it should be possible to programmatically retrieve their historical interactions. Could that assumption allow you to query for the recommendations for the current user? (Note: this also means the current user didn't necessarily need to be in the training data, whereas if you query by user ID they would need to be.)

To give an example, suppose the user ID is `1234`, and their interactions within the app are rating items `x`, `y`, and `z`, each with rating 5 (note: use `-1` as a placeholder if the model was trained without explicit ratings). So to get the same result as calling `recommend(users=[1234])` in Python, you'd call something like `[model predictionWithInteractions:@[@""x"": 5, @""y"": 5, @""z"": 5] k:5]` in Objective C using the CoreML model. This is the equivalent of the [`recommend_from_interactions`](https://apple.github.io/turicreate/docs/api/generated/turicreate.recommender.item_similarity_recommender.ItemSimilarityRecommender.recommend_from_interactions.html#turicreate.recommender.item_similarity_recommender.ItemSimilarityRecommender.recommend_from_interactions) method in Python.

I've been having these same issues whenever using the models that return VNRecognizedObjectObservations since WWDC 2018 when using Apple's demo apps:
https://developer.apple.com/documentation/vision/tracking_multiple_objects_or_rectangles_in_video
https://developer.apple.com/documentation/vision/recognizing_objects_in_live_capture

In addition to the bounding boxes being way off, I'm also getting unrealistically high confidence scores (0.999+ in most cases), which also increases the false positives to the point that the model is not usable. When I use the older model type that returns VNCoreMLFeatureValueObservation with demo apps from last year, the bounding boxes are far more accurate and the confidence scores are reasonable/accurate.

At this point, I've started to continue using the older model type from last year and rebuilt several of my object detection apps to accommodate this. I'd much rather using the newer features and code, as it's cleaner and likely won't be phased out as quickly -- but after months of troubleshooting without any breakthrough, I've had to stick with what works.",luck one still ca tell issue create vision framework apple whenever return since apple addition bounding way also getting high confidence also false point model usable use older model type last year bounding far accurate confidence point continue older model type last year rebuilt several object detection accommodate much rather code cleaner likely wo quickly without breakthrough stick work,issue,positive,positive,neutral,neutral,positive,positive
431614001,"As I've been experimenting quite a bit with getting the performance in order -- I've been able to get Turi Create to utilize much, much more of my GPUs power; not all of it, but a much more sizeable chunk.

To do this -- I resized the data images that were originally taken with my iPhone X and iPhone XS. Previously, I had only compressed them but did not resize them. Once I compressed them gently and resized them to 416x416 (without maintaining the aspect ratio) using preview in MacOS, I had file sizes of less than 200kb each. Once I trained the images in Turi, things trained much more quickly and for the first time ever, I was able to see my 5 GPUs use roughly 100w of power each, with their utilization on each sitting between 60% and 100%. I increased my batch size to about 560, which pushed my 5 GPUs (GTX 1080Tis) to their limit without receiving memory errors.

I figured that if the issue was with a bottleneck in the Python script's performance (even with my 18-core CPU (due to lack of script optimization) that if I resized them ahead of training that I'd have less of a bottleneck. That seems to be the case. 

Most importantly, the model's performance is spectacular when used in my app in a real-world setting -- the resizing of source material to 416x416 without maintaining the aspect ratio and my gentle compression (using jpegoptim) didn't seem to hurt things as far as I can tell. My evaluation in Turi and in real-world usage accurately detects models with a 88%+ confidence score.

I used RectLabel to annotate my data and was concerned that I would have to spend many many hours redoing previous work after resizing the images; but after opening up the resized images in RectLabel, the bounding boxes adjusted appropriately without having to redo that part of my work. I'm not entirely sure how that worked out in my favor, but I'm happy it did!

I know that there are many more optimizations can take place on the side of Turi Create, such as the C++ implementation mentioned by @nickjong (I'm definitely excited for this!)... but this small tweak made a big difference for me personally. I'm not a machine learning expert (quite noobish, actually) so I am not sure if this was a bad idea, but the final model is performing very well and that's all that really matters to me.

431119607,"I have been struggling with this same issue as well when providing my own CoreML model created with TuriCreate 5.1 to the BreakfastFinder. The bounding boxes that are drawn within the app are very offset.

As another user mentioned in this issue, I too am getting ridiculously high confidence scores with the new default Turi CoreML export format -- with all recongized objects coming back at 0.999+ confidence scores, which makes filtering out false positives very difficult. When I export in the older CoreML format and use a different demo app, the confidence scores are at reasonable and expected levels, false positives are easy to filter out, and the bounding boxes work quite a bit better. 

If I hold the phone in portrait mode and place the object to be detected at the top of the view, the bounding box is close-ish to the object, but several pixels lower than it should be. The problem gets worse as I move the object lower towards the bottom of the phone. The lower the object is inside the camera's view, the worse the bounding box offset placement is. Holding the phone in landscape mode doesn't really seem to make much of a difference and the offset still varies depending on where the object is detected on screen.

I can't figure out why this offset is so severe or why the confidence scores, even for false positives on just about any 'detected' object is so high when using the default CoreML export options in Turi 5.0+

## Networks

There are two different networks used.

- A generator network we call Transformer. `src/unity/python/turicreate/toolkits/style_transfer/_model.py:106`

- A VGG-16 network that's used for training the Transformer Network. `src/unity/python/turicreate/toolkits/style_transfer/_model.py:192`

## Training

The training process is as such.

### Forward Pass
- A forward pass through the Transformer Network using the Content Images.
- A forward pass through the VGG-16 Network using both the Content and Style Images respectively

### Style Loss
- We keep track of the outputs after some of the activation layers `[relu1_2, relu2_2, relu3_3, relu4_3]` we calculate the gram matrix using the outputs of these activation layers for the Content and Style Images respectively. `src/unity/python/turicreate/toolkits/style_transfer/style_transfer.py:316`

- The addition of these losses is the `style_loss`

### Content Loss
- An additional L2 loss is computed between the output `[relu3_3]` after the forward pass of the Content and Style Images we call this the `content_loss`

### Total Loss
- We add the losses together and only update the beta and gamma weights in the InstanceNorm layers of the Transformer Network.

Repeating this training process in a training loop allows us to create a Transformer network that can quickly stylize images. See `src/unity/python/turicreate/toolkits/style_transfer/style_transfer.py:283` for the training loop.

I hope this explained the process in which we train the style transfer model.",thanks question specific implementation use current style transfer two different used generator network call transformer network used training transformer network training training process forward pas forward pas transformer network content forward pas network content style respectively style loss keep track activation calculate gram matrix activation content style respectively addition content loss additional loss output forward pas content style call total loss add together update beta gamma transformer network training process training loop u create transformer network quickly stylize see training loop hope process train style transfer model,issue,positive,positive,neutral,neutral,positive,positive

When training my Object Detector, I can see the memory usage of each GPU fill up (see attached screenshot) -- but the amount of energy these cards using is very low. Very rarely have I seen one of the GPUs hit more than 50w usage and most of the time the fans do not even blow (indicating the cards aren't being used very heavily). I don't imagine it would be an input bottleneck given the performance

I set my configs in the script to:
`tc.config.set_num_gpus(-1)`

When I begin training, I see the message: 
`""Using GPUs to create model (GeForce GTX 1080Ti, GeForce GTX 1080Ti, GeForce GTX 1080Ti, GeForce GTX 1080Ti, GeForce GTX 1080Ti)""`

Is this normal behavior to only utilize the GPUs available memory, or should the cards actually be using their GPU muscle to push through the Object Detector training?

`model = tc.objector_detector.create(train_data, feature='image', annotations='annotations', batch_size=512, max_iterations=10000)`

I‚Äôm having doubts about whether test_add_column_noniterable2(self) which I added should exist. I noticed that passing a noniterable to an empty SFrame does not store the element as a size one SArray: 

>>> import turicreate as tc
>>> sf = tc.SFrame()
>>> sf['x']=3
>>> sf
Columns:
	x	int

Rows: 0

Data:
	[]

Whereas test_add_column_noniterable2 checks if an noniterable is passed to an empty SFrame it is stored as a size 1 SArray.

It took about 9 hours to complete 10 iterations, compared to 21 hours with CreateML using vision feature print scene. However, the accuracy at iteration 10 for TC was not as good as the accuracy of iteration 3 of CML, which took about 9 hours to complete. So, it seems it's twice as fast to iterate, but you have to iterate just as long to obtain the same level of accuracy. Maybe more data would help as noted - I had 10 images for each class.

I did not expect that there was a simple answer to my question. You have presented some very nice guidelines for what to expect and I will be looking into the YOLO9000 paper.

However, if you say for instance that you don't want partially occluded objects to be detected at all, that is a consistent behavior that the model can learn. With that said, you have many choices of what to do with occluded objects.

1. Ignore the occlusion and define the bounding box as if the object was fully visible.

2. Take the occlusion into account when defining the tight bounding box (this is popular in the academic literature).

3. Choose not detect partially visible objects at all.

All these three are consistent behaviors that the model can learn. The choice is entirely up to what you want the detector's behavior to be.

418945735,"@gustavla,

Thanks for the detailed response! This is very helpful. The reason I asked about occlusion is because of a statement from the object detection user guide:

""If you are trying to detect persons, then every occurrence of a person should warrant a ground truth bounding box. If you leave some persons unmarked, the model can get confused why some persons are marked as positives (presence of an instance) while others are marked as negatives (absence of an instance)"" (https://github.com/apple/turicreate/tree/master/userguide/object_detection)

So, I assumed that occluded items need to be considered. For example, what if my class was an Apple. And I had a bowl of Apples in an image. Do I simply put bounding boxes around the Apples that are fully visible? Or all of them including those partially visible? Or do I ignore these types of images for training purposes.

And to clarify my ""train twice"" question,  what I'm asking is if there's a way to use my existing model for transfer learning expand it's capabilities. It seems now that I have to start from scratch each time. Is that correct?

418921837,"@aicts Thanks for the followup! We definitely would like to use eGPU here, but for image classification the relevant computation is actually performed by CoreML.

So we're dependent on a code change there, which would have to happen in a new version of macOS....

It's interesting that you observed CreateML using the correct GPU. If you change the feature model for the TuriCreate image classifier to ""VisionFeaturePrint_Screen"" you should in theory obtain the same behavior as CreateML, e.g.
```
model = tc.image_classifer.create(dataset, target, model='VisionFeaturePrint_Screen')

418901618,"Hi @sejersbol, sorry for the really long delay here!

Unfortunately I do not know where the breaking point is, and of course it will depend on acceptable evaluation metrics and training data size.

From a technical point of view there is no hard limit and if you go to extremes there could be Core ML model size issues and memory issues during inferences. However, that will only happen for extremely large number of classes.

From a modeling perspective (which is a problem that will happen much earlier than the technical limitation) it is not as clear. As you increase the number of classes, you increase the risk of making classification mistakes. Although, the severity of a lot of the mistakes should simultaneously go down as you will have more and more classes that are naturally similar (breeds of dogs, etc.). The original YOLO9000 paper (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1612.08242.pdf) trained a model using 9000+ classes with reasonable results (lots of mistakes of course, but still impressive). They trained it on a combination of detection and classification data, so if they actually had detection data for all 9000, then results would presumably be even better.

In your experiment it sounds like 50-60 was OK (thanks for giving us a sample point!). Anything below 100 is definitely tried and true, as long as you have the data. However, will 300 do OK? Will 1000 do OK? Theoretically I would say yes, if you are able to provide enough training data and you adjust your expectation of what a good evaluation metric is, since you know you'll make more mistakes. For instance, for classification with 1000 classes, it is common to report top-5 accuracy (that is, the correct label is in your top-5 classes for a sample).",hi sorry really long delay unfortunately know breaking point course depend acceptable evaluation metric training data size technical point view hard limit go could core model size memory however happen extremely large number class modeling perspective problem happen much technical limitation clear increase number class increase risk making classification although severity lot simultaneously go class naturally similar dog original paper trained model class reasonable lot course still impressive trained combination detection classification data actually detection data would presumably even better experiment like thanks giving u sample point anything definitely tried true long data however theoretically would say yes able provide enough training data adjust expectation good evaluation metric since know make instance classification class common report accuracy correct label class sample,issue,positive,positive,positive,positive,positive,positive
418898088,"Hi @henrytkirk. Really sorry for the long delay!

Any unrecognized field added to the annotation dictionary will be ignored by the model. Let me present some alternatives, but I will first make some guesses as to what you are trying to achieve. My guess is that you have for instance N classes and for certain objects you want to mark if the instance is occluded or not. Now, we do not have support for multi-label detection, which would mean having separately independent targets (1. class, 2. occlusion yes/no).

However, you can pre-combine these two targets, so that your new ""classes"" are:
* class1
* class1-occluded
* class2
* class2-occluded
* ...

This is not quite ideal, but it may work out.

As for your second question of training the model twice. I assume you mean starting the training from an already trained model, right? No, this is currently not supported. It's related to checkpointing (#574), although that feature request does not explicitly specify if it should be possible to resume training. This is something that we have discussed, but we have not committed to supporting it at this point. It introduces a lot of reproducibility issues and it is also not trivial how to set learning rates fully automatically in such a setting.",hi really sorry long delay unrecognized field added annotation dictionary model let present first make trying achieve guess instance class certain want mark instance support detection would mean separately independent class occlusion however two new class class class quite ideal may work second question training model twice assume mean starting training already trained model right currently related although feature request explicitly specify possible resume training something supporting point lot reproducibility also trivial set learning fully automatically setting,issue,positive,positive,neutral,neutral,positive,positive

418089570,"Hi @eddydas, thanks for the feedback!

As a matter of fact - the Activity Classifier is a general purpose time series classification toolkit. It is agnostic to which sensors you select for your task, as long as you use the same sensors for training as the ones you will use for real time prediction.  
It is definitely not limited to motion sensors (thought that is of course the classical use case) - any sensor measured at a constant rate may be used - e.g. heart rate, depth sensor, luminance sensors etc.    
Even in the case of motion sensors - the choice of inputs is up to the library's user, and changes from one project to another. While some applications may benefit from using `motion.gravity.x + motion.userAcceleration.x` as you've suggested, others may want to use `motion.userAcceleration.x` alone to detect certain movements of the phone itself.

The purpose of the [documentation page](https://apple.github.io/turicreate/docs/userguide/activity_classifier/export_coreml.html#applying-the-core-ml-model-in-an-app) was simply to show how to use an activity classifier trained model in an iOS app, regardless of the specific use case.

Having said that - since the example used throughout the documentation section, HAPT dataset, **does** use total acceleration (including gravity) - you're probably right üòÑ . The documentation should at least be consistent.

So, today I tried to upgrade to Turi Create 5.0 and run my training script again. This time it all went well!

I'm currently creating a model with Create ML, so using vision feature print, and it's been training for 24 hours now... üòÆ Do you suspect it would be quicker with Turi Create using Squeezenet due to the smaller number of features it outputs?

For some context, the data set is handwritten characters. Just now found in the documentation for Create ML feature extractors, it states in regards to vision feature print: ""It isn‚Äôt suitable for character recognition, for example, where the input images are highly binary in nature"". (This would be good to document in Turi Create as well!) Is that the case for Squeezenet too?

If you try creating an image classifier with 6,000 categories (or any other large number of categories), please let us know how it goes.

SFrame operations are lazily evaluated. So it could be just that a lot of computation needs to be done before the SFrame is ready to be visualized. You could try calling `.__materialize__()` before calling `.explore()`, to insure the SFrame is ready to be visualized.

This should be set already, but you could also try calling: `turicreate.visualization.set_target(target='auto')` before calling `.explore()`.

If that doesn't solve the issue, please open up a new issue with some more details.

Since I am suspecting that the message displayed may not be reflecting the actual batch size, I cannot say what the default batch size is.

When using CPU, it automatically sets the batch size to 32 and the message shows the correct batch size.  If I change the batch size to 16, it shows batch size is set to 16.  Essentially, the batch size displayed is the same as what is set in my python script.

Well, it's hard to say. The MBP can sometimes have shared GPU memory or some of them can be occupied with some other process (like X rendering). I'm using a Linux PC with no UI at all with a GTX 970 (4 GB of VRAM) and I could train with a batch size of 32. But I noticed that if there is not enough memory when I set the batch size to 32 it is put back to 16 before training by the system (I wouldn't call it bug, since otherwise would probably crash).

What I would suggest you as alternative is to use CPU to make initial tests (with a iteration limit of ~200) to see if the loss lowers down in these iterations (with 200 iterations should already low enough to see that is training well), then I would move everything to an (example) Amazon GPU service and train everything there without setting any iteration limits (Turi Create has already a very good algorithm to guess the correct amount of iterations based on the input you have).

I was under the impression that a higher batch size took up more memory.  So I had tried setting it to 8.  But the console print out said ‚Äò setting batch_size to 16‚Äô and it did not help.  So I thought it did not take the batch size value.  I took your advice and set the batch size to 32 and even though it still printed out ‚ÄòSetting batch size to 16‚Äô,  it looks like I am not getting ‚ÄòNaN‚Äô any more (at least not so far).  Let us see.  So the print out must be wrong!

It could be due the fact that using CPU you may have a batch_size of at least 32 while with GPU it may not using the same value. Check this parameter and eventually try to set to 32 also for the GPU.
You can find the reference in the doc<https://apple.github.io/turicreate/docs/api/generated/turicreate.object_detector.create.html>.

But also as @TobyRoseman<https://github.com/TobyRoseman> pointed, 50 images are too less for the training.

414119690,"@nickjong - I agree, the train-validation split probably should move to the C++ part. This will also save the need to calculate the number of sessions using SFrame operations - which is quite slow.

It does seem though that 100 sessions is a too high threshold for most datasets. It seems that most users collect much fewer data. Even the HAPT dataset (which we consider small, but may very well be a typical one) only has 42 sessions.  
For the time being - maybe we can add another threshold for `num_sessions` above which we do the split but verify that both sets include all possible labels. I.e.:
```python
if num_sessions < 30:
     #don't do split
if num_sessions > 30 and num_sessions <100:
     train, valid = split()
     if len(train[target].unique())) != len(valid[target].unique())):
           #give some warning\error
if num_sessions > 100:
      train, valid = split()
     # just split. Verifying will probably be quite slow
```

414111628,"@nickjong nice catch! I wasn't aware of this disadvantage of Boyre-Moore algorithm.

@znation - As Nick has mentioned, this shouldn't really affect the correctness too much (if at all). Most prediction windows are expected to contain a single label, besides transition windows that may have two.  
In the HATP example Nick mentioned - it's not likely that a user has done 3 completely different activities (e.g. walking, running and swimming) within a single second. This probably indicates either wrong data labeling or selecting an inappropriate window size - both of which are errors of a much larger magnitude.

I would even say that if the histogram solution (which @abhishekpratapa has already [implemented](https://github.com/apple/turicreate/pull/1005/)) is a bit slower - it might even not be worth it.",nice catch aware disadvantage algorithm nick really affect correctness much prediction contain single label besides transition may two example nick likely user done completely different walking running swimming within single second probably either wrong data inappropriate window size much magnitude would even say histogram solution already bit might even worth,issue,negative,positive,neutral,neutral,positive,positive

Then the algorithm _could_ do the wrong thing if the window contains an interval of less than half a second labeled with A, preceded and followed by two distinct labels B and C. You would think that for most domains, you would choose a prediction window whose granularity matches the data labeling granularity to some degree.

With regard to step 2, note that most of our supervised toolkits currently just use the heuristic of using a validation set when the number of instances is above 100. I think the main question here is what is an ""instance"". A session feels like it's much bigger than an instance, since it may comprise several prediction windows, each of which has a separate (if not independent label). Given that our implementation already splits each session into segments of 20 prediction windows, we could in theory do the auto split if we have at least 100 of these 20-window segments.

412906389,"Hi @tetreault,

Actually - it's the other way around üòÑ   
We've added a safeguard in v.50b3 that prevents from creating an automatic validation test if the dataset is too small. The reason, as I have mentioned above, is to try to prevent the case that both train and test sets contain only part of the labels (motions).   
I admit this decision is done rather crudely - we simply don't allow splitting if there's less than a certain amount of sessions (currently hard coded to 100).  

In addition - the safeguard was added mainly to prevent the `activity_classifier.create()` function from creating an auto validation set. In no way it should block a user who is explicitly calling the `random_split_by_session()` API. 

I'm changing this issue to a feature request, so we will add:
1. As a first step - an enforce flag to `random_split_by_session()`, allowing the user to split his sessions on any dataset when using this API.
2. We should probably improve the decision mechanism for whether or not to create a validation set during `create()`. It should check the labels distribution of the train and validation sets (or some other method) - rather then a hard limit on the number of sessions.

So now I'm using the code specified for creating the model (see [here](https://apple.github.io/turicreate/docs/userguide/activity_classifier/)). This data set now is the full HAPT data set, so much much larger than my 3.5k rows I put together myself.

412445384,"@tetreault - it seems that you dataset is too small. Please try to collect more data.  

It seems that you have collected a single session from each activity (motion) - you should collect a larger number of activities - taken at different times (maybe even from different users).  
Note that a session may include a person doing a variety of activities. You don't have to record data of someone only sitting, then only standing etc. It's ok if you do - but then try to have at least 4-5 different sessions of each activity.

You could try to artificially break down the data you already have to shorter sessions - but then you would probably encounter the original problem mentioned in #813 .

I'm closing the issue for now. Feel free to re-open if you have more questions or encounter further problems.",small please try collect data collected single session activity motion collect number taken different time maybe even different note session may include person variety record data someone sitting standing try least different session activity could try artificially break data already shorter session would probably encounter original problem issue feel free encounter,issue,positive,negative,neutral,neutral,negative,negative
412443834,"Copy of my previous reply in the other thread:

First - please verify that you use the latest `turicreate` version, 5.0b3. There was a bug recently fixed in `random_split_by_session()`. You can do it by either running `pip freeze | grep turicreate` in shell, or `print tc.__version__` in python.

In addition, can you please provide the output of the following prints?
```
len(dataSFrame['exp_id'].unique())
len(train['motion'].unique())
len(test['motion'].unique())
```
It seems that your train set only contains two sessions? Is that correct?  
The train set should contain examples from all supported activities. During training a mapping is created that maps all supported activities to integers, and this mapping is used by the prediction/evaluation functions. It is also advisable that the test set contain a mixture of all activities (though not mandatory).

I'm surprised you even got a valid train-test split. The `random_split_by_session()` function is not intended for very small datasets - from the very reason that it is not likely to randomly include all activities if the data is too small. It should have errored out and refuse to do the split below a certain number of sessions (currently hard coded to 100).",copy previous reply thread first please verify use latest version bug recently fixed either running pip freeze shell print python addition please provide output following train test train set two session correct train set contain training used also advisable test set contain mixture though mandatory even got valid split function intended small reason likely randomly include data small refuse split certain number session currently hard,issue,positive,negative,neutral,neutral,negative,negative
412368744,"Second post: 

Hey guys! Sorry for hijacking this thread my mistake :) I understand if this should be in a new thread. 

For starters, I'm definitely using an older version, in my console I see `turicreate==4.3.2` which is just what pip installed. 

Overall my data i'm loading in to the SFrame has 4 sessions. 

The lines you asked me to run above result in the following: 

```
len(dataSFrame['exp_id'].unique()) # outputs 4
len(train['motion'].unique()) # outputs 3
len(test['motion'].unique()) # outputs 1
```

So therein lies the problem I suppose, if I get the error `ToolkitError: Size of prediction probability vector(3) != number of classes(1).` and i'm seeing 3 of the sessions are in train, but only 1 in test?

412305495,"Total machine learning noob here but came across Turi because I have a task that requires somewhat reliably going from standing-to-kneeling posture (and ideally vice versa). I was following along with the documentation, and made sure my preprocessed CSV mirrors the format used in the table in the ""advanced usage"" section. 

I'm running the following python script to generate a model: 

```
import turicreate as tc
dataSFrame = tc.SFrame('motion_data_all.csv')

# Train/test split by recording sessions
train, test = tc.activity_classifier.util.random_split_by_session(dataSFrame, session_id='exp_id', fraction=0.8)

# Create an activity classifier
motion_model = tc.activity_classifier.create(train, session_id='exp_id', target='motion', prediction_window=50)

metrics = motion_model.evaluate(test)
print(metrics['accuracy'])

# Save the model for later use in Turi Create
motion_model.save('motion_model.model')

# Export for use in Core ML
motion_model.export_coreml('MotionActivityClassifier.mlmodel')

# try out the model 
model_test_data = dataSFrame[(dataSFrame['motion'] == 'sit') & (dataSFrame['exp_id'] == 1)][500:1000]
motion_model.predict(model_test_data, output_frequency='per_window')
```

My training data is extremely small, as far as ML training data goes. Approx 3.5k rows of standing/sitting/kneeling, each accurately labeled. In the doc you use the HAPT data and then process it into a format with `exp_id` and the activity label. My data set mirrors that end result. 

When I run the following line in spyder: 

```
metrics = motion_model.evaluate(test)
print(metrics['accuracy'])
```

**I get the following error: `ToolkitError: Size of prediction probability vector(3) != number of classes(1).`**

Just to be clear I'm not completely messing up from the start, I've included some screenshots from the file I use with the following: `dataSFrame = tc.SFrame('motion_data_all.csv')`.

We chose to make predictions using the most information we have during prediction time. The default option for prediction is imputing when features are not present during predict time.  For a single example, if a single feature is missing, imputing is probably the right thing to do. In batch mode, if one example in one row is missing, imputing a single value is the right thing to do. When you add these two things up and want a consistent API, the current API is the only choice. 

The user always has the option of turning off imputation in all the predict calls but that's not the default option. Changing the default will revert the ""right"" thing to do in those other cases but make this case less of a surprise. We could warn the user that we are imputing a lot of data and still continue.

```swift
if let observations = results as? [VNCoreMLFeatureValueObservation] {
    print(""is VNCoreMLFeatureValueObservation"", observations)
 }
```
What will happen is one of two things:

1. There is a detection and `results` is for instance a `[VNRecognizedObjectObservation]` with one or more elements. In this case, your `if let` statement fails to convert to it to `[VNCoreMLFeatureValueObservation]` and nothing gets printed.

2. There is no detection (which will be common when moving the camera around, or happen consistently for an under-trained model), so `results` is an empty array and has no problem being converted to an empty array of `VNCoreMLFeatureValueObservation`. You print ""is VNCoreMLFeatureValueObservation"" without actually having any `VNCoreMLFeatureValueObservation` objects. I experimentally confirmed this behavior.

So, please use the following code instead:
```swift
for observation in results {
    print(""observation %s"", observation)
}
```
I think you'll see that you do not get any `VNCoreMLFeatureValueObservation` objects when using a model with NMS.

411093581,"@cianiandreadev has a great point, so let me re-iterate the different scenarios and the expected behavior (which I have experimentally verified at least on my setup):

1. You have a model with NMS (type: Pipeline) and targeting iOS 12 that has been sufficiently trained and pointing at an object of interest: You should get an `VNRecognizedObjectObservation` object. If not, it could simply be a false negative (failure of the algorithm to detect the object), so try multiple objects (if you point it at a training sample, it should definitely fire).

2.  You have a model with NMS (type: Pipeline) and targeting iOS 12, but you did not sufficiently train the model. In this case, your result array will simply be empty. For instance, a model after only 10 iterations will always give no predictions whatsoever, since it hasn't gained enough confidence to do anything else. If you still want to do this for quick testing, make sure to set confidence threshold to 0, so that no predictions are eliminated due to low confidence. You should start seeing some `VNRecognizedObjectObservation`, but they will not be good predictions.

3. You have a model without NMS (type: Neural Network). Vision will return a `VNCoreMLFeatureValueObservation` object each iteration. This information need to be processed further to be interpreted as predictions. The BreakfastFinder app will unfortunately not give any indication that this is happening, but you can add something like this inside `drawVisionRequestResults` to check what is being returned:
    ```swift
            for observation in results {
                print(""observation %s"", observation)
            }
    ```

4. You do not have iOS 12 (which is the only case I haven't experimentally verified yet), in which case I believe the results will be the same as point 3, regardless of the Core ML model.

Looking through a lot of the earlier comments in this issue, I think many of you have were hitting one of these expected behaviors. The problem is that between TurI Create and the BreakfastFinder app, we have done a really poor job communicating these subtle differences and what the expected outcome should be. That is something that we need to address through better  documentation or changing the example code.

However, if there is someone that does not fall into these four cases, then that is definitely a bug and a separate issue. It sounds like this is what might be happening for @nthState and @amiraeitan, so let's dig further. 

@nthState Does the BreakfastFinder app work when it is unchanged for you? Can you also confirm with `xcodebuild -showsdks` that Xcode is finding the iOS 12 SDK?

@amiraeitan You report that the default model works, so the difference must lie in the Core ML model. Have you confirmed that you are getting `VNCoreMLFeatureValueObservation` objects just like @nthState? If you are simply not getting any results at all, then that behavior falls into point 2 above. Also, I can't see iOS 12 SDK in your list of SDKs - are you sure you are successfully compiling against iOS 12?

410860893,"We have updated several issues with this previously, but usually these issues boil down to numerical inaccuracies that are next to impossible to prevent.  The main reason is that the boosted trees model often uses values from the training dataset in determining the split points.  At these specific values, calling the models at these specific values can often give a different prediction.  

The reasons for this are usually due to two things. First, the training is done with float32, but predictions in CoreML are done with float64, and minor differences in the numerical values cause the model to go down different branches, and these different branches will have different predictions.  Second, converting from decimal values to float32 or float64 (e.g. reading from a CSV file, giving it explicitly, etc.) will produce slightly different numbers.  In other words, each of the following routes can be a different number:  decimal->float64, decimal->float32, decimal->float64->float32, float64->float32, etc.  As a result, if the original value was present in the training data, each of these paths may give a different prediction.  Thus, when testing boosted tree model export, it's very difficult to use values from the training data.

To test this, did you ever try doing predictions on a set of already taken images and then compared the results? It's hard to do a perfectly fair comparison between macOS and iOS on a live app, especially since the sensors are different. That difference in sensors can also be what is causing a degradation in performance. If you want to target both macOS and iOS with a single model, I would recommend using training data that is a mix of data taken from MacBooks and iPhones.

409089319,"@johnyquest7 Are you sure then that CUDA is installed? Since it can't find `nvcc`, it means at least your PATH is not pointing to the CUDA location.

If CoLab installs it in a different path, perhaps it also sets an environment variable describing where it is. Check:

```
env | grep CUDA
```
You can also try something like this to see if if the CUDA include directory is being picked up:
```
echo '#include <cuda.h>' | cpp -H -o /dev/null 2>&1 | head -n1
```
If neither of those work, it looks from our end that CUDA is not installed. As a sanity check you should also check if you can run the command `nvidia-smi`. However, this command comes with your NVIDIA drivers and not with CUDA, but it will be a pre-requisite for installing CUDA, so that command should be available at least.",sure since ca find least path pointing location different path perhaps also environment variable check also try something like see include directory picked echo include head neither work end sanity check also check run command however command come command available least,issue,positive,positive,neutral,neutral,positive,positive

The output format is the same with `include_non_maximum_suppression`, but the suppression of such duplicates is built in.
2. It also makes the output recognizable by the Vision framework. If we don't have the post-processing included, the Vision framework will not recognize the output as bounding box output. In this case, we have to interpret the output manually, which is described in the user guide that I linked to.

So, I wouldn't expect to get a `VNRecognizedObjectObservation` if the post-processing is not included in the mlmodel.

Then I created a blank macOS project, dropped in most of the code from the iOS sample, got it rendering the preview and drawing the overlays but: the position of the bounding box overlays is off (this could be that I have missed something re. the orientation of the MPB camera vs iPhone camera?), `VNImageRectForNormalizedRect` is returning a lot of rects with `NaN` values ‚Äì usually heights soI added a check to skip them, and finally, the confidences returned by in the results from the model are all `0.5`.

I agree that it is annoying to have to change all the prediction code to override these at runtime. We are definitely hoping to address this in the future. Sorry for the inconvenience!

By the way, more generally, the best way to open up an mlmodel and modify it is to use `coremltools`. Although, just a warning, this is not always trivial and can involve calling `get_spec()` on the MLModel and manually go through the protobuf object to change things. This can be tricky, but not as tricky as manually hacking the binary code. Hope that helps!

405667602,"Thanks for the prompt response yesterday to my inquiry - great to know how active the team is, gives me more confidence in using it.

is there any information you can share (or pointer to the SFrame/GL github, for the flow that was used in the _internal.search functionality, which I could replicate externally to the modules, for example leveraging some of the text_analytics components to create my own functions that leverage the functionality in turicreate to obtain similar results?

Now, let me share a bit about how i'm using it.

I have been using the SFrame module to analyze, cluster and group a couple of public data sets. Two in particular.
1) all retirement plans in the US since 2009. The SFrame modules have been extremely useful. The data is openly available from https://www.dol.gov/agencies/ebsa/about-ebsa/our-activities/public-disclosure/foia/form-5500-datasets
2) all 990 IRS tax filings for Exempt Organizations https://docs.opendata.aws/irs-990/readme.html

Both of these datasets are based on human entered data, which can both vary from year to year, and in some cases are intentionally differentiated. Particular search fields are company names. Various attempts to normalize the company names led to more complexity and edge cases. Eventually I loaded the data into elasticsearch which allowed me to search the data, but not so useful for pythonic analysis. Inverted index searching was the way to go.

Eventually I stumbled upon the _internal.search model function and started to use it for pythonic data analysis - taking a name, looking for similar ones using the search criteria, and adding those to a new column in the SFrame, so i could then use that to normalize the data (using EIN's as the key). Amongst other uses, such as creating a dashboard that lets a user search for a company/plan name across multiple fields (Company name and Plan name in the retirement dataset can reinforce and rank higher something that otherwise would not) Additionally there are nested objects inside of another column that has service provider data, and i do an index on that information to search for plans that for example have ""fidelity"" as a service provider to the retirement plan. It does a great job providing me a with a quick queryable list of candidates, without loading all the data into solr or es to generate the queries, and keeps everything inside of python, i can also generate models for subsets, and deploy the model to AWS lambda (my intention) to support much quicker, analysis for multiple iterations that are needed on some functions. (i could also use ES for this going forward, which is my current approach in lieu of the search model).

One hypothetical example is ""BLUE CROSS BLUE SHIELD"" while they are all different entities (regional and local), they all belong to a collective group. This is noted either in their plan name, mailing address, administrative name, etc.) and in different formats, spellings, abbreviations, etc. These are across both 401k and 403b plans. 

I create multiple search models (k) is for 401k plans and (b) is for 403b plans

```
m_srch_sfmain_k = gl._internal.search.create(sfmain_k, features=['SPONSOR_DFE_NAME', 'PLAN_NAME', 'SPONS_DFE_CARE_OF_NAME','SPONS_DFE_DBA_NAME'], verbose=False)
m_srch_sfmain_k.save('m_srch_sfmain_k')
m_srch_sfmain_b = gl._internal.search.create(sfmain_b, features=['SPONSOR_DFE_NAME', 'PLAN_NAME', 'SPONS_DFE_CARE_OF_NAME','SPONS_DFE_DBA_NAME'], verbose=False)
m_srch_sfmain_b.save('m_srch_sfmain_b')
```


For each of the search models, i then look for the highest likelihood candidates, parse the dates, extract the service providers, and generate a matrix based on those that have a score of N.

```
bcbs_k = m_srch_sfmain_k.query(""BLUE CROSS BLUE SHIELD"",
                               num_results=1000)['score',

Please see attached a [notebook](https://github.com/apple/turicreate/files/2199413/auto_workout_classifier_turi-create.ipynb.zip) with my analyses.  

I'm afraid that my main conclusion is that I couldn't find any set-up in which the AC performs significantly better on this dataset.  
The main reason, I believe, are the short sessions. Having short sessions of 10 sec each, with a prediction window of 2 seconds - means that every session only has about 5 windows on it.  
Since the RNN in the AC is learning across these windows - having such short sequences (5 samples long) makes it hard for the RNN to gain much knowledge.

Thanks for the elaborate reply! 

It is indeed peculiar that you see such a big difference in performance (91% vs 45%). Sounds like something is off. I would indeed suspect some incorrect usage of the AC.  
I do have a few ideas from the top of my head (will elaborate soon) - but it would be best to just try to investigate with the actual data.

402445223,"hi @igiloh and thanks for such a broad answer!

Now the logic behind using session IDs is clear to me.

I work on http://autoworkout.app/ which currently recognizes 11 activities using 3 deep feedforward NN s each fed with accelerometer data from X, Y, Z axis respectively and each having accuracy of ~0.91% +- 0.05% and F1-score of 0.92 +- 0.01. All 3 NNs work in an ensemble and there is a custom algorithm which makes a final prediction. Predictions are made each ~1.8 seconds.

And even with the accuracy stated above I still feel a need for improving it, because it's critical from the user's perspective. I gave Turi Create a quick try and was able to reach only 45-51% accuracy (trained on 1120 sessions) even after extensively searching for optimal hyperparameters. The data Turi's activity classifier was trained on was the same, AutoWorkout's one had been trained on.

And here is a small excerpt of training data from a single recording session, containing a single activity:

![training_data](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1609148/42273346-328498ea-7f89-11e8-836c-8339ca49ca3e.png)

While looking for the ways of improving Turi's classifier performance, I thought that probably the data format could be an issue in my case: the whole dataset consists of recording sessions 10 seconds long, containing a single actor and a single activity each. But according to your explanation such a format is rather expected from Turi, so there should not be an issue.

Another proble, which is coming to my mind is the absence of gyroscope samples in training data (in case of AutoWorkout classifier, gyroscope data didn't contribute a lot into the accuracy).

Is there anything else I should take a look to to improve Turi's classifier performance?

402416156,"Hi @vmalyi, 

Thank you for trying out the Activity Classifier, and for the elaborate feedback!

As you can imagine - the session id is indeed stripped in the pre-processing stage. Before training the DNN - the sessions are being cropped into non-overlapping, constant length time sequences.  These constant length sequences (let's denote them ""chunks"") are the actual training samples being fed to the network.

The main motivation behind the session id requirement is to make sure that samples from two separate users don't get into the same chunk (instead - the last chunk of each sessions is being padded and then weighted out by the loss function).  
Another advantage of using sessions is it provides a single identification for consecutive data from a specific user. If we would have used time stamps only - data taken at the same time from two different users might have gotten intermixed. Or alternatively by using user_id only - two different recordings, taken at completely different times, might have been fused together to the same chunk.  
Lastly - using sessions improves the train-test split mechanism. Splitting whole sessions increases the test set's independence, by making sure that correlated chunks coming from the same user don't end up in both the training and the test set. 

Can you please share some more information about your human activity recognition problem, and the algorithms you've been comparing with?  
The AC have been tested with several similar datasets (multi-class human activities, such as running, walking etc.). We have tried to design the AC to generalize well for a wide variety of datasets.

but I still get the same error log I shared previously. I think my error is related to boost where I see these three errors message:
```

@hoytak When I leave off the libunity.a while compiling 
```

```
The three errors mentioned above are resolved I guess but I still get these errors:
```

```
So in both cases I know it's realted to boost. I am just unable to figure out if I am missing some environement variable or I need to pass some additional flag while compiling which would remove these boost library errors.

@znation  My model_predict.cpp file is same as shown in example of the documentation (https://apple.github.io/turicreate/docs/userguide/cpp.html). I have created mushroom.tcmodel and it's in the same directory as the model_predict.cpp. I am not sharing the model code here since that is also same from the documentation however, I am sharing the model_predict.cpp.

To read this kind of JSON format into SFrame, it would be easiest to use the built-in `json` package, since that type of structure (a single object with key/value pairs) doesn't map directly to the SFrame table structure and thus isn't supported by `turicreate.SFrame.read_json`. Instead, we can provide that mapping through code:

```python
import json
import turicreate as tc

# read the JSON file into an in-memory object
with open('file.json', 'rb') as f:
    obj = json.load(f)

# get that JSON object into SFrame format (gives a single column of [key, value])
# note that `items` is what allows us to map this key/value structure into a table structure
sf = tc.SFrame(obj.items())

# transform the SFrame into two columns, and rename them appropriately
sf = sf.unpack('X1')
sf = sf.rename({'X1.0': 'path', 'X1.1': 'annotations'})

As a matter of fact - I've just finished fixing this bug, the fix is coming up in a few hours üòÄ.

As for a workaround - there are two simple options:
1. When you're calling  `create()`  - pass in the param `validation_set=None`. This will train the model without a validation set.
2. Use your own validation set. If you've already saved aside a few of the training sessions - just pass them in as another SFrame, to the `validation_set` param.
For example:
```
train = tc.SFrame(sessions_1-200.csv)
valid = tc.Sframe(sessions_201-250.csv)
model = tc.activity_classifier.create(train, ... , validation_set=valid)

398585334,"Hi @bobdillon48, please see the [User guide chapter](https://apple.github.io/turicreate/docs/userguide/object_detection/#data-acquisition) on Object Detection, which gives examples of the JSON format used for describing the bounding boxes. The bounding box description for a single row (where each image's metadata is a row of your CSV), would look something like this:

```json
[{""coordinates"": {""height"": 104, ""width"": 110, ""x"": 115, ""y"": 216}, ""label"": ""ball""}]
```

Note that there could be more than one object annotation per image, which is why this is a JSON array. I think a single object is also valid.

To construct a CSV file that would describe each image this way, you'd want two columns, one for the path to the image (relative paths from within a directory where you will execute the script tends to work best), and one for the annotations. The resulting CSV file would look something like:


```csv
path,annotations
images/image1.jpg,[{""coordinates"": {""height"": 104, ""width"": 110, ""x"": 115, ""y"": 216}, ""label"": ""ball""}]
images/image2.jpg,[{""coordinates"": {""height"": 208, ""width"": 40, ""x"": 48, ""y"": 29}, ""label"": ""tree""}]
```

Then, you can read the resulting file into SFrame format with `turicreate.SFrame.read_csv` and join it to your images with `join` (assuming the path column name is the same, and contains the same image paths, in both SFrames).

I'm also going to leave this issue open and tag as `docs`, so we can use it to track updating the documentation to make it clearer.

> Are you prioritizing low latency, high accuracy, short training time, or a small model size? In your experience, why is SSD or Faster R-CNN the answer to this?

My priority is accuracy and then very closely latency. Model size does matter to some extent, but would prefer the other two hands down. Short training time is absolutely meaningless.

In it's current form turicreate is just not usable for my use cases. The accuracy of tinyYOLO can't be relied upon for real world applications. Therefore, I've had to fall back to using faster r-cnn on device. Would really love a CoreML implementation of faster r-cnn. Maybe I'll just do it myself.

395953024,"@enzyme69 I was able to repro your error.

It happens if you use number of content images less than default batch_size (which is `6` currently).

Reason is due to raising `StopIteration` in ` style_transfer/_sframe_loader.py`:
```
        if self.cur_epoch == self.num_epochs or len(self.sframe) == 0:  
            raise StopIteration
```

We should use try and except block on `StopIteration` as per https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0479/

Is this your iMac: https://support.apple.com/kb/sp688?locale=en_US ?

If so, the reason why you are not seeing GPU acceleration is because the graphics card is NVIDIA and  not AMD (as in more recent Macs). Not to worry though, since we also have support for NVIDIA graphics cards.

There are a few more steps to set this up however. First, make sure you have CUDA installed, for instance CUDA 8. Optionally install cuDNN as well, which will lead to greater performance. Finally, uninstall MXNet (`pip uninstall mxnet`) and install the CUDA-enabled MXnet (corresponding to your CUDA version):
```
pip install mxnet-cu80==1.1.0
```

A discrepancy (even a subtle one) between your training data and testing data, is the most typical reason for getting poor results.

I'm glad to hear that you're finding Turi Create helpful for building your AI powered app!  
Have your tried the [activity classification toolkit](https://apple.github.io/turicreate/docs/userguide/activity_classifier/)? It's designed specifically for this kind of tasks.

Let me try to answer all of your questions:
> Is Turi Create optimized for Apple Watch classification?

TC is degined to support any kind of ML task, on a variety of OSes and devices.  
Having said that - the ability to easily create Core ML models makes it a perfect tool for creating powerful Apple Watch, iOS and macOS applications.  
Activity classifcation using Apple Watch and iPhone sensors was of course tested and demonstrated to be an exelnet use case for TC.
> Is it important on which body part the device is located? In the demos I've only seen iPhone-like devices in the pocket.
What if I recorded training data on the left wrist and someone wears their watch on the right wrist?

As in any machine learning model, training on a wide range of scenarios would asisst the model to generalize and get better results.  
It hard to tell how a model would behave before actually testing it - but of course that introducing a completely different scenario on inference, which the model never had the chance to train on, is likely to produce poorer results.
> Which parameters of CMDeviceMotion would be best to feed into Turi Create? Right now I use `.userAcceleration` and `.rotationRate`?

We generally don't tend to advise on project specific details.  
On a general note - some classification tasks would benefit from using calbrated readings, such as `.userAcceleration` and `.rotationRate`, while others would produce better results by using raw sensors readings such as `.CMGyroData`.  
My best advice would be to try both approaches (no point in intermixing them, as they're corelated with each other), and see what works best for your use case.

```
// Compute validation-set stats.
if (lr_interface->num_validation_examples() > 0) {
         // Recycle lvalues from stats to use as out parameters here, now that we're

This is an extremely expensive operation and I'm not sure why we are doing it at the end of training. The right fix should be to replace that function with

```

If that function doesn't exist, we should add it since the code that follows doesn't actually need to compute the Hessian.

379329941,"Hi @andremontenegrof, the correct way is the second (empty list), although None may also work.

Let's look at your example of adding an empty list to an SArray. So, this SArray will be a list where each element represents an image. If I re-write what you had as one element per line, it looks like this:
```
train_data2_annotations = [
  {'coordinates': {'y': 32, 'x': 147, 'width': 290, 'height': 67}, 'label': 'Sneaker'}, 
  {'coordinates': {'y': 1124, 'x': 1777, 'width': 105, 'height': 265}, 'label': 'Sneaker2'}, 
  [],
]
```
Every element must itself be a list. So, if you intended for this SArray to hold the information for three images, the last one being a pure negative, it should have the following format:
```
train_data2_annotations = [
  [{'coordinates': {'y': 32, 'x': 147, 'width': 290, 'height': 67}, 'label': 'Sneaker'}], 
  [{'coordinates': {'y': 1124, 'x': 1777, 'width': 105, 'height': 265}, 'label': 'Sneaker2'}], 
  [],

turicreate needs a location on disk to write temporary files. I believe the default for that location is not writable in kaggle kernel. When I set my location to an unwritable path, I get the exact same behavior you're seeing on kaggle kernel.

Please try doing the following right after you have imported turicreate:
`tc.config.set_runtime_config('TURI_CACHE_FILE_LOCATIONS', '<writable-path>')`

370665864,"Hi @johnyquest7, I thought I would add some more detailed info. All vision toolkits (classifier/similarity/detector) perform implicit resizing to get the data into a fixed size expected by the underlying model. For instance, the ResNet-50 backend for the classifier takes a 224x224 image, so if you provide an image of size 500x400, it will be automatically resized to 224x224 before passed to the model. It may violate the aspect ratio doing this, but the classifier networks are pretty robust to this kind of deformation. There is no cropping involved.

This is what happens at test time for all three models and during training for classifier/similarity. The object detector during training on the other hand does extensive data augmentation, which means each time an image is presented to the algorithm (each image repeated many times) will be randomly resized, cropped, translated, color perturbed, and mirror flipped.",hi thought would add detailed vision perform implicit get data fixed size underlying model instance classifier image provide image size automatically model may violate aspect ratio classifier pretty robust kind deformation involved test time three training object detector training hand extensive data augmentation time image algorithm image repeated many time randomly color perturbed mirror,issue,positive,positive,positive,positive,positive,positive

368829740,"Hi @LennartOlsen,  sorry that you're having this problem

A few things that come to mind:
1. Are you initializing your `dataArray` at some point? It should be initialized (probably to zeros) before the first calls to `predict()` - so if any of the sensors' readings are missing, you would still have some numerical value in the array.
2. It seems that you're only casting Accelerometer data to `Float`. Are the other sensors guaranteed to be floats? Can you try casting these as well?
2. Better yet - can you please try casting all of them to `Double`? (it seems that your `Measurement` is defined as `Double` anyway). The exported model probably expects `Double`s as input (you can check by double-clicking the `mlmodel` file in Xcode).
3. Could it be that you sometimes call `PerformPrediction()` with only part of the sensors in `dataEntry`? For example with a Gyroscope measurement only, but without new Magnetometer reading? 
If so - the other sensors must be attended to somehow (filled with some default values). 
Otherwise - you keep calling some of the sensors with their previous readings, and in case of the first call - with some uninitialized values.  

Could you please try running a simpler model with just one of the sensors, just to rule out all of the possible errors above?  
Could you also please try using your code (all 3 sensors), on the same devices, but with the built-in sensors?  

Last but not least - if none of the above helps, could you please try to record some data from your sensor and send it in some format (csv etc)? I'd like to try to reproduce your problem, using your app, in order to debug it.",hi sorry problem come mind point probably first predict missing would still numerical value array casting accelerometer data float try casting well better yet please try casting double measurement defined double anyway model probably double input check file could sometimes call part example gyroscope measurement without new magnetometer reading must somehow filled default otherwise keep calling previous case first call could please try running simpler model one rule possible could also please try code last least none could please try record data sensor send format like try reproduce problem order,issue,positive,positive,neutral,neutral,positive,positive
368814398,"Hi @johnyquest7 , thanks for your question

Theoretically, TC's visualization tool should allow you to plot the ROC by using the `tc.show()` function:
```
turicreate.show(ev['roc_curve']['fpr'], ev['roc_curve']['tpr'])
```  
However, as mentioned in https://github.com/apple/turicreate/issues/142, it's not yet possible to request a specific plot type (a scatter plot in this case) - so sadly the plot won't show correctly for the moment.  

The quickest workaround is to use `matplotlib`:
```
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
plt.scatter(ev['roc_curve']['fpr'], ev['roc_curve']['tpr'])
```
If you're using Jupyter notebooks, you can add `%matplotlib inline` after importing `matplotlib`, this will make the drawing appear within the notebook.

Sorry for the delay in answering your question -- missed it when you first asked it.

The recommender models (or all of our models, currently) stay the same once created.  You'll have to retrain the models on the old and new data combined to get an improved model.  However, they do accept additional observation data with the recommend function, as you pointed out, and this is used to improve the recommendations at that specific call to recommend.  It's pretty much the same as having it be part of the original data in the first place in terms of accuracy, but it is slower.

The workflow use of the recommender model that we were envisioning is to have the models be retrained and validated regularly, but to have data accumulated since the last training be passed in to `recommend()` to keep the context and recommendations current.

366490798,"Thanks for reporting this and sorry that you are having issues! You are right, it does look like it's coming from MXNet and more specifically from the data augmentation. This makes me think that perhaps a certain image or bounding box annotation in your input is triggering a rare bug in MXNet.

Let's try to figure out what's going on. First of all, what version of MXNet are you running? You can check this by `pip freeze | grep -i mxnet` in your terminal. Then, let's try the very latest development version of MXNet instead:

```
pip install mxnet==1.1.0b20180217

Turi Create may give a warning that it lacks official support, but things should hopefully still work. This will tell us if this is a bug that has been fixed already. If it's still an issue, it would be great if we could narrow down the sample(s) that are causing problems. If it would be at all possible to share the data, that would be the easiest (we can connect privately over email, so it would only be with me). Of course, I understand completely if this is not possible.

```

359776806,"In practice I've found that YOLO9000's accuracy isn't as good as SSD or Faster R-CNN (speed is another story, YOLO is very speedy). YOLO can also be more challenging to train, depending on the task. As you also noted, YOLO doesn't work well with small objects. Of course, this is based on my own experiences.

It's impossible to say ""this architecture is always the best"" because (as we know) which architecture + training procedure is best is _highly_ dependent on the dataset, task, and project.

My general rule of thumb is that if speed isn't a concern, Faster R-CNN is a good starting point. If speed is paramount and accuracy can suffer a bit, give YOLO a try. If a middle ground is needed, start with SSD variants (SSD + MobileNet for speed; SSD + Inception for potentially higher accuracy but longer inference time) and go from there.

Again, that is just my rule of thumb from my own personal experience training these networks on a number of datasets.

359712175,"Hi @CogMachines, I uploaded the [C++ docs](https://apple.github.io/turicreate/docs/cpp/). Since those can be kind of unapproachable (more of a class/function reference than a howto -- the search works well, but I don't tend to browse), I also wanted to add some sample code here.

Let's assume we're starting with the model that results from the introductory example in the [boosted trees classifier](https://github.com/apple/turicreate/blob/3490286b27ff5d79cb90d09fe026d5671ce990c7/userguide/supervised-learning/boosted_trees_classifier.md#gradient-boosted-regression-trees) section of the user guide. The model is available as [mushroom.tcmodel.zip](https://github.com/apple/turicreate/files/1654991/mushroom.tcmodel.zip) as well.

To make predictions from this model in Python, you could run:
```python
import turicreate as tc
data =  tc.SFrame.read_csv('turicreate/lfs/datasets/xgboost/mushroom.csv')
model = tc.load_model('temp4/mushroom.tcmodel')
data[0]
```

358116188,"The current behavior is exactly what you mentioned; everything is implicitly castable to string.  And I agree with you -- I think it should be either strict or follow the semantics of to<...>(), not somewhere in between. 

The weird behavior in question is due to the following use case.  The Levenstein distance is exposed directly through the extensions mechanism as 

`double levenshtein(const std::string& a, std::string& b);`

The test that's failing simply calls this function with a list and a dict types and asserts that an exception is raised -- i.e. the previous behavior here raised an error; the new mechanism does not.  

I suspect that what changed is the converter did actually change behavior in this, but the implicit casting behavior went through the flex_list converter method and showed up only here.  Thus the old converter didn't match the behavior of the class and now it does.

357794631,"@igiloh I think I misspoke with IDEs - this change is intended for editors that don't do their own build, and don't have proper completion without the aid of external plugins. Those plugins typically depend on something like `compile_commands.json`.

I tested it with the [YouCompleteMe](http://valloric.github.io/YouCompleteMe/#c-family-semantic-completion) vim plugin and it works -- I get true semantic completion instead of the normal vim ""tag""-based completion.

A few other tools that I haven't tried, but claim to be compatible with this `compile_commands.json` file:

* [linter-gcc](https://atom.io/packages/linter-gcc) for Atom
* [vscode-cpptools](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-cpptools/blob/master/Documentation/Getting%20started.md#how-to-specify-the-include-paths) for Visual Studio Code
* [flycheck-cmake](https://github.com/xwl/flycheck-cmake) for Emacs
* [auto-complete-clang](https://github.com/xwl/auto-complete-clang) for Emacs

```bash
rm -rf debug/ release/ && ./configure && pushd debug/src/unity && time make -j8 && popd

In my 5 runs, there was no difference between the wall clock time of the build on `master` and this PR branch. (In fact, this branch was 2s faster on average, but with a stdev of around 5s.)

I went back and scrutinized my rectangle calculations - but it still seems like the coordinate system and math is correct. I also tried drawing the returned rectangles outside of the app; I used Pixelmator to hand-identify the detected locations returned to the app.  The Pixelmator experiments matched what I was seeing in the CoreML app. The locations are just 5-10% off (if that makes sense); and they are not always consistently offset along some axis. In fact, sometimes one to three sides of the rectangle are pretty close, but the others are off - but not that far off.

Anyway, it also seems like the confidence values may be different as well - although it's hard to compare between Turi Create and CoreML since I don't know how to aggregate the confidence value of multiple predictions to perform the equivalent calculation that's shown in the Turi Create visualizer.

So, if you want, I can post the code and artifacts, but it would be better to do it privately if possible?

* No output is directly sent to `stderr`.
* Debug/info/warning/error messages are routed through the Python [logging](https://docs.python.org/2/library/logging.html) API, with a consistent and predictable module naming scheme (perhaps all of `turicreate`, or perhaps sub-modules), so the user can control from Python which strings are sent where.",good question issue enhancement track supporting separately selectively turning printed think ideal state output directly sent exception like explicitly print console like simply return value string output directly sent python logging consistent predictable module naming scheme perhaps perhaps user control python sent,issue,positive,positive,positive,positive,positive,positive

To make sure, you should make sure that (0, 0) results in the upper-left corner (not lower-left, which I think might be the coordinate system of the view - if that's the case, you'll have to do 1 - y on that axis). Also make sure that (1, 1) results in the lower-right.

I am setting up a script to reproduce this now thanks to all your scripts and the dataset. However, I do think I know what's going on already. As part of the a pre-processing step, the object detector takes all images in the SFrame and decodes them. This is to avoid the overhead of constantly decoding them. However, your images are large and some take up to 23 MB uncompressed. The way the object detector uses the SFrame is not optimal, since normally out-of-memory datasets are well handled. This is definitely something I want to see improved in the object detector.

As a work-around before this has addressed, you can try to scale down your images a bit first. They will be scaled down before they are passed into the neural network anyway, so it won't make a difference for the model performance. You can do something like this to get the size down:

```python
sf['image'] = sf['image'].apply(lambda image: tc.image_analysis.resize(image, image.width//4, image.height//4, image.channels))
```

Let me know if that works as a temporary work-around.

354913109,"Thanks @znation, that is really useful overview! I think we need to distinguish model save/load and SFrame save/load though, at least from an implementation point of view. Right now, SFrame in Python 3 automatically decodes strings as UTF-8 (likewise in Python 2 when displaying strings). This does not happen automatically for the model states for some reason, which is exactly what this PR does manually. If the model states behaved like SFrames, this PR would not be needed at all.

As for the SFrame, its behavior is essentially Option 1 right now. This mostly works except for two main issues (and a separate bug that I just opened an issue for in #157):
- In Python 2 only bytes indexing is supported and in Python 3 only unicode indexing is supported
- Python 2 and 3 both support saving byte strings that are not valid UTF-8. In Python 2 this is mostly fine (printing fails with a missing symbol), while in Python 3 this is a fatal error.

That we are allowing non-ascii/non-utf8 bytes to go into an SFrame is not great, since these should probably more appropriately use the `array` type in the first place. There is an option between 1 and 2 where we keep the Python 2 behavior but introduce deprecation warnings (that we could wait to enforce strictly until a major version bump). Apart from the breaking change, the fact that Python 2 and 3 only support indexing with their respective `str` is a bit strict, but it is consistent with Python 3 behavior in general:

```python
>>> {b'foo': 100}[u'foo']
```
This works in Python 2, and it doesn't matter what combination of  `b` and `u` you have. The same exact discussion applies to regular values and string equality checks (`b'foo' == u'foo'`). However, if your key is a unicode with non-ascii characters, then you can't index it with a byte string (even if it's utf-8 encoded). In Python 3, indexing across bytes and unicode is simply forbidden altogether even if you only have ascii in your strings. What makes Turi Create's behavior a bit weird is that whatever you put into the SFrame, you always end up with UTF-8-encoded bytes in Python 2, and unicode in Python 3. This can lead to unintuitive indexing or equality checks where the value you just put in does not seem to match what you get out:

Currently in Python 2:
```python
>>> key = u'\u00aa'
>>> tc.SArray([{key: 100}])[0][key]
KeyError
>>> tc.SArray([{key: 100}])[0][key.encode('utf-8')]
100
>>> tc.SArray([key])[0] == key
__main__:1: UnicodeWarning: Unicode equal comparison failed to convert both arguments to Unicode - interpreting them as being unequal
False
>>> tc.SArray([key])[0] == key.encode('utf-8')
True
```
Currently in Python 3:
```python
>>> key = b'foo'
>>> tc.SArray([{key: 100}])[0][key]
KeyError
>>> tc.SArray([{key: 100}])[0][key.decode('utf-8')]
100
>>> tc.SArray([key])[0] == key
False
>>> tc.SArray([key])[0] == key.decode('utf-8')
True
```
I purposely made this example using an SArray, since that means the `KeyError` or the equality check is happening from a native Python data type and not directly from an SFrame/SArray. Of course, for things like SFrame column indexing, we could theoretically support dual bytes/unicode indexing and do the encode/decode implicitly. However, we could not extend this kind of support to the example above or two equality checks. That is, under Option 1 or 2. If we introduce a separate string type, as Option 4 proposes, then we could avoid this type of inconsistent behavior.

I'm not sure Option 4 as you describe it is even possible. The reason is because we already support unicode input in Python 2 and it has the implicit UTF-8 encoding behavior as outlined above. So, if we keep Python 2 behavior exactly (assuming compatibility with 4.0), the new text type would only ever be used in Python 3 when a unicode object is used. This would be really strange in many ways, especially since Python 2 would then be able to open and load these as unicode, but if the information is re-saved it would again go in as a UTF-8-encoded bytes. It would also be strange to have two unicode-supporting string types.

For Option 4 to really make sense it would have to be more like Python 3, where the Turi Create bytes/unicode would share semantics with Python's bytes/unicode types (and UTF-8 is never implied. although it can be an implementation detail for the unicode type). However, that would be a pretty major breaking change to the current behavior. Probably much more disruptive than the breaking change in Option 2.

I don't think Option 3 offers an acceptable UX in Python 3.",thanks really useful overview think need distinguish model though least implementation point view right python automatically likewise python happen automatically model reason exactly manually model like would behavior essentially option right mostly work except two main separate bug issue python indexing python indexing python support saving valid python mostly fine printing missing symbol python fatal error go great since probably appropriately use array type first place option keep python behavior introduce deprecation could wait enforce strictly major version bump apart breaking change fact python support indexing respective bit strict consistent python behavior general python work python matter combination exact discussion regular string equality however key ca index string even python indexing across simply forbidden altogether even ascii create behavior bit weird whatever put always end python python lead unintuitive indexing equality value put seem match get currently python python key key key key key key equal comparison convert unequal false key true currently python python key key key key key key false key true purposely made example since equality check happening native python data type directly course like column indexing could theoretically support dual indexing implicitly however could extend kind support example two equality option introduce separate string type option could avoid type inconsistent behavior sure option describe even possible reason already support input python implicit behavior outlined keep python behavior exactly assuming compatibility new text type would ever used python object used would really strange many way especially since python would able open load information would go would also strange two string option really make sense would like python create would share semantics python never although implementation detail type however would pretty major breaking change current behavior probably much disruptive breaking change option think option acceptable python,issue,positive,positive,positive,positive,positive,positive

354600320,"Hi @jrosebr1,

There seem to be a bug in the code [gist you've provided.](https://gist.github.com/jrosebr1/8dff34056420b819576560c86ff6dd00).
In line 62 you check if `filename != imagePath`, but you never set `filename` after the first line of the first CSV. This means that instead of ending up with one line per image file - you end up with a huge SFrame that has a single line per annotation. Not to mention that all the lines have the same image in their `image` column (the very first one in the db).
I don't know if this is exactly the same code you've been using - but if it is, that might explain the exploding disk size you're getting.

Regardless of this bug, I've written a short script to load your images without using `SFrameBuilder`. Please see [here](https://gist.github.com/igiloh/43ffbbbc216dd264ad42463c9992bfc6).
My only assumption was that your xml to csv converter would add a header line at the beginning of each csv file, with the column names `imagePath, startX, startY, endX, endY, label` (It can be done also without that, let me know if you need the code).

Please let me know if any of these solutions (fixing the bug or trying out my code) now works for you.

354177329,"@jrosebr1 thanks again for the extremely detailed report!!!

SFrames are lazily evaluated, so SFrame operations which you're performing aren't actually being calculated until the data is required. The `sf.materialize()` method forces that SFrame to perform all of the operations in its calculation graph.
`materialize` is usually useful if you've performed several pre-processing steps, and are about to iterate over the same SFrame (as in the case of several training epochs etc.).
However, materializing is irrelevant in your case, since SFrames built by `SFrameBuilder` will always be materialized.

Nevertheless - using `SFrameBuilder` might explain the HD explosion, as the SframeBuilder uses a very large cache, as described in https://github.com/apple/turicreate/issues/102.

While I'm downloading the entire dataset and trying to reproduce the problem - I'll be really glad if you could please upload a small subset of about 10-15 images, with their respective CSVs (after you conversion from xml).

The goal of this dataset is to train an object detector that can recognize the front and rear ends of cars. Images were annotated using dlib's `imglab` tool.

I parsed `imglab`'s resulting .xml files to a simple CSV file (this part is totally irrelevant but I thoughtI would share anyway):

https://gist.github.com/jrosebr1/a1a98fb114db50a5dadcf75b23c99a7c

And then used this code to build the SFrame dataset:

https://gist.github.com/jrosebr1/8dff34056420b819576560c86ff6dd00

The gist is that I initialized `tc.SFrameBuilder`, loop over the image annotations, parsed the bounding boxes, and then added the individual image + bounding box to the `SFrameBuilder `object. Once all annotations had been parsed I called `.close` to save the database.

And then trained using this code:

As to your questions:

* I opened #142 to track adding an API to select plot type. Currently only the automatic selection is possible.
* I opened #143 to track allowing more than one series per axis in plots where this makes sense.

For your scenario of Absent/Present in one plot, you may be able to use a single two-column plot to represent what you want, by rearranging the data. I'm not sure what the current arrangement looks like, but assuming you have two columns like:

```
Columns:
	Date	str
	Attendance	str

| 12/02/17 |  Present   |
| 12/03/17 |  Present   |
+----------+------------+
[3 rows x 2 columns]
```

You can plot this with `tc.show(sf['Date'], sf['Attendance'])`.

353886276,"@gustavla Hmm. I think we have lots of options here to resolve this issue (correct me if any of these won't work):

1. Assume strings contain `utf-8` encoded text when necessary to make an assumption for Python 3, and error out otherwise. Python 2 would still continue to work with arbitrary byte strings, but the models and data produced may not be loadable in Python 3. (I think that's what's in this PR?)
    * Pros: non-intrusive code change, no UX change to existing scenarios.
    * Cons: Turi Create in Python 3 would not quite be compatible with Python 2 in terms of behavior/data/models.

2. Require strings to contain `utf-8` encoded text, and validate this in both Python 2 and Python 3 to prevent incompatibilities between the two. Note: this would potentially break loading existing SFrames or models from 4.0.
    * Pros: full compatibility between Python 2 and Python 3.
    * Cons: breaking compatibility with 4.0, no support for arbitrary byte strings or other encodings.

3. Keep the same semantics in Python 3 as in Python 2, which implies we would only ever use the `bytes` type in both. (Currently, we use the `str` type in both, but this has different semantics in Python 2 and Python 3; as I understand `bytes` has the same semantics in both Python 2 and 3 as our current semantics, and is what `str` maps to in Python 2).
    * Pros: full compatibility between Python 2 and Python 3, full compatibility with 4.0.
    * Cons: not very Pythonic (in Python 3 especially). Users expect the `str`/`unicode` type to work in Python 3 (and probably the `unicode` type in 2 as well).

4. Add a new `text` type in SFrame that implies utf-8 encoding and uses the `unicode` Python type; this is basically option 2 + option 3. We could potentially rename the current `str` type to `bytes` as well to remove confusion.
    * Pros: full compatibility between Python 2 and 3, full compatibility with 4.0.
    * Cons: two string types. This could cause user confusion (in the same way that Python having two string types does üòÑ ).

However, if you are getting this on an image where you feel there is an object that it should find, then we need to figure out why it wasn't able to learn this.

First of all, try lowering the confidence threshold. This should give you a lot of bounding boxes (although many of them seemingly random with very low confidence):

```python
model.predict(sf, confidence_threshold=0)
```

Is the top prediction at least somewhat reasonable? If not, then I would go back to your training data and visualize it to make sure everything looks good. You can also try making a prediction on a training sample - the model should get this right with high confidence. Also, how many classes and samples did you have in your training set?

352541223,"At first, I thought this was a bug but now on second thought, I think this is correct behavior. There are 2 concepts:

1. All group-by operators in turicreate follow the skip None policy i.e they will omit all missing values from the aggregation.  As an example, `sum([None, 5, 10]) = 15` if you assume that the None is skipped. 
2. Additionally, in python/pandas/numpy etc, `sum([]) = 0` which is exactly what turicreate does as well. 

Hence, using the skip None policy and the sum of nothing is 0 policy, we get an answer of zero when you are trying to do `sum([None]) = sum([]) = 0` for the group `a`.

With the same principle in mind, we cannot get 0.0 for the mean because the mean is undefined if there are no points. Hence, using the skip None policy, we have `mean([None]) = mean([]) = None (undefined)` and hence you get None.

We can make the case that None values are skipped more clear in the groupby documentation. I'll file a separate issue for that.

352497812,"Thanks for trying out the object detector! I really appreciate the detailed report of this bug, since it made it very easy for me to understand the issue. The problem is that we are not handling images with 4 channels (RGB + opacity channel) correctly.

I will work on a fix and in the meantime let's discuss work-arounds to get your model working. If you want to train the model to leverage the opacity channel, then the current version will unfortunately not support that. However, if you get rid of the opacity channel then this error message will disappear. You can either manually convert your images before loading them, or you can do it through Turi Create:

```python
def drop_alpha(image):
    return tc.Image(_image_data=image.pixel_data[..., :3].tobytes(),
                    _width=image.width,
                    _height=image.height,
                    _channels=3,
                    _format_enum=2,
                    _image_data_size=image.width * image.height * 3)

sf['image_rgb'] = sf['image'].apply(drop_alpha)
```

Removing the opacity channel of an image can be done in several ways. The question is, do we replace the transparent background with white or black, or something else? The above method is blunt and simply drops the opacity channel. This will work if most of your images do not actually use the extra channel.

As @srikris have mentioned - the CoreML team is aware of the problem with Homebrew.
There are several recommended ways to install python on macOS:
1. Using [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/what-is-anaconda/) - my personal favorite.
2. Downloading directly from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/mac-osx/).
3. Use the native python version that comes with macOS, which is located in `/usr/bin/python`.

All of which have been tested and work well with both turicreate and coremltools.

My only criticism is that this seems like a very important piece for building large SFrames, but the API is very obscure. Also doing it this way is much much slower than directly writing out to a file. For example in tensorflow you can directly write out a single tfrecord, whereas with SFrame it's basically all built in memory. That memory then gets partially cached to the disk and then after all that it gets written back out to a saved SFrame.

Instead, you could try using the [SFrameBuilder](https://apple.github.io/turicreate/docs/api/generated/turicreate.SFrameBuilder.html), which is a helper class exactly created for this purpose: building up an SFrame row by row.

351890988,"Thanks for the quick response! 

I am doing object detection, but I created the dataset using existing code I had for tensorflow. All the image paths + classes are stored in a db and the images are stored in a directory. I do some additional processing to the image so each image is loaded individually via worker queues and then a single worker would write it out sequentially to a training dataset file.

This worked well for larger datasets because tensorflow allows writing out an individual training example, I wasn't able to find anything like that in the sframe docs. I initially tried appending separate sframes, but I could never get that to work. So I store them all in a single list and when all the processing is done I create the sframe and write it out to a file. This is only possible because I have enough RAM.

My sframe structure is exactly like the object detection documentation. 2 columns, but well over 100k rows.

For a slightly broader context, companies like Apple, Facebook, Google, and Microsoft exert a lot of influence over the developer community, with starry eyed developers eager to try the latest offerings.

This can be somewhat evidenced by looking at the JavaScript frontend ecosystem, where many options with significantly overlapping purpose and design compete for adoption and mindshare. Competition comes at a cost of fragmentation and somewhat subverts efforts to standardize technologies in a vendor neutral, cross-cutting manner (e.g. web standards).

I tried outlining the key differences above. The overlap in terms of functionality is pretty high. The SFrame is pretty full featured and we plan to keep building on it and adding more things as we find gaps. The APIs are pretty similar so it should be quite natural to use them.

> Also, how does SFrame compare with the design goals and foundations of Dask? E.g.

Dask is another great project that we are aware of. It started around a year after the SFrame and at its core is a task scheduler that can help scale up Pandas using pure python primitives. It has some of the advantages of SFrame (parallelism, scale, interop with pandas etc.) but not all of them (can be extended to multiple languages, lazy evaluation, compression, interop with pandas etc.)

350840764,"@brylie Thanks for your feedback! 

We have been actively developing the SFrame for over 4 years now. There are many reasons why we like SFrame.

- Its out of core so you can work with really large datasets
- Lazy evaluation lets you work interactively even on really large datasets
- Its fast! and has some awesome compression techniques that make sure you can do more with less
- Because it is written in C++, we can have support for multiple-languages in the future
- Its parallel 
- Built in visualization tools that can handle a lot of data (in a streaming way, so you can see your plots right away)

We love the pandas project and have met with the creators and contributors many times and have all the respect for pandas. For that reason Pandas and SFrame are fully interoperable through [to_dataframe](https://apple.github.io/turicreate/docs/api/generated/turicreate.SFrame.to_dataframe.html#turicreate.SFrame.to_dataframe) and [construction](https://apple.github.io/turicreate/docs/api/generated/turicreate.SFrame.html).

What can help is the following:

- We can provide more clarification with the user guide on the differences with Pandas and SFrame
- Add a user guide chapter on inter-op between Pandas and SFrame

The steps for building the `hapt_data.sframe` are indeed missing from the current documentation, and you can find them here: https://github.com/apple/turicreate/issues/41#issuecomment-350538212

As for file paths (csv files to be loaded, saved sframe files and saved model files) - please note that all of the methods below accept any full or relative path you'll provide them:
```
sf = tc.SFrame.read_csv('some/path/some_file.csv')
sf.save('some/other/path/my_data.sf')
loaded_sf = tc.SFrame('some/other/path/my_data.sf')
model.save('new_desired_path/my_model.model`)
```

The current path your're running your python from doesn't matter - as long as you provide a valid path where you want sframes\models to be saved to or loaded from.

Also, it is not required to run your python script from within a specific path (`venv` or any other). 
 The only advice is to activate the virtualenv in which you've installed turicreate by running: `source ~/venv/bin/activate`.
After you do - feel free to write your own `.py` script or ipython notebook. Such script will usually begin with:
```
import turicreate as tc
data = tc.Sframe.read_csv('some_data.csv')
#...
model = tc.activity_classifier.create(data, ...)
#...
```

Feel free to ask for any further clarifications.",hi thank taking interest activity classifier building indeed missing current documentation find file loaded saved saved model please note accept full relative path provide current path running python matter long provide valid path want saved loaded also run python script within specific path advice activate running source feel free write script notebook script usually begin import data model data feel free ask,issue,positive,positive,neutral,neutral,positive,positive
