    <summary>Contributor License Agreement</summary>
    
### Contribution License Agreement
This Contribution License Agreement (**“Agreement”**) is agreed to by the party signing below (**“You”**),
and conveys certain license rights to Microsoft Corporation and its affiliates (“Microsoft”) for Your
contributions to Microsoft open source projects. This Agreement is effective as of the latest signature
date below.
1. **Definitions**.
**“Code”** means the computer software code, whether in human-readable or machine-executable form,
that is delivered by You to Microsoft under this Agreement.
**“Project”** means any of the projects owned or managed by Microsoft and offered under a license
approved by the Open Source Initiative (www.opensource.org).
**“Submit”** is the act of uploading, submitting, transmitting, or distributing code or other content to any
Project, including but not limited to communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control
systems, and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the Project for the purpose of
discussing and improving that Project, but excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or
otherwise designated in writing by You as “Not a Submission.”
**“Submission”** means the Code and any other copyrightable material Submitted by You, including any
associated comments and documentation.
2. **Your Submission**. You must agree to the terms of this Agreement before making a Submission to any
Project. This Agreement covers any and all Submissions that You, now or in the future (except as
described in Section 4 below), Submit to any Project.
3. **Originality of Work**. You represent that each of Your Submissions is entirely Your original work.
Should You wish to Submit materials that are not Your original work, You may Submit them separately
to the Project if You (a) retain all copyright and license information that was in the materials as You
received them, (b) in the description accompanying Your Submission, include the phrase “Submission
containing materials of a third party:” followed by the names of the third party and any licenses or other
restrictions of which You are aware, and (c) follow any other instructions in the Project’s written
guidelines concerning Submissions.
4. **Your Employer**. References to “employer” in this Agreement include Your employer or anyone else
for whom You are acting in making Your Submission, e.g. as a contractor, vendor, or agent. If Your
Submission is made in the course of Your work for an employer or Your employer has intellectual
property rights in Your Submission by contract or applicable law, You must secure permission from Your
employer to make the Submission before signing this Agreement. In that case, the term “You” in this
Agreement will refer to You and the employer collectively. If You change employers in the future and
desire to Submit additional Submissions for the new employer, then You agree to sign a new Agreement
and secure permission from the new employer before Submitting those Submissions.
5. **Licenses**.
  * **Copyright License**. You grant Microsoft, and those who receive the Submission directly or
indirectly from Microsoft, a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, irrevocable license in the
Submission to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, and distribute
the Submission and such derivative works, and to sublicense any or all of the foregoing rights to third
parties.
  * **Patent License**. You grant Microsoft, and those who receive the Submission directly or
indirectly from Microsoft, a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, irrevocable license under
Your patent claims that are necessarily infringed by the Submission or the combination of the
Submission with the Project to which it was Submitted to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell and
import or otherwise dispose of the Submission alone or with the Project.
  * **Other Rights Reserved**. Each party reserves all rights not expressly granted in this Agreement.
No additional licenses or rights whatsoever (including, without limitation, any implied licenses) are
granted by implication, exhaustion, estoppel or otherwise.
6. **Representations and Warranties**. You represent that You are legally entitled to grant the above
licenses. You represent that each of Your Submissions is entirely Your original work (except as You may
have disclosed under Section 3). You represent that You have secured permission from Your employer to
make the Submission in cases where Your Submission is made in the course of Your work for Your
employer or Your employer has intellectual property rights in Your Submission by contract or applicable
law. If You are signing this Agreement on behalf of Your employer, You represent and warrant that You
have the necessary authority to bind the listed employer to the obligations contained in this Agreement.
You are not expected to provide support for Your Submission, unless You choose to do so. UNLESS
REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING, AND EXCEPT FOR THE WARRANTIES
EXPRESSLY STATED IN SECTIONS 3, 4, AND 6, THE SUBMISSION PROVIDED UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS
PROVIDED WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, ANY WARRANTY OF
NONINFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
7. **Notice to Microsoft**. You agree to notify Microsoft in writing of any facts or circumstances of which
You later become aware that would make Your representations in this Agreement inaccurate in any
respect.
8. **Information about Submissions**. You agree that contributions to Projects and information about
contributions may be maintained indefinitely and disclosed publicly, including Your name and other
information that You submit with Your Submission.
9. **Governing Law/Jurisdiction**. This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of Washington, and

Washington, unless no federal subject matter jurisdiction exists, in which case the parties consent to
exclusive jurisdiction and venue in the Superior Court of King County, Washington. The parties waive all
defenses of lack of personal jurisdiction and forum non-conveniens.
10. **Entire Agreement/Assignment**. This Agreement is the entire agreement between the parties, and
supersedes any and all prior agreements, understandings or communications, written or oral, between
the parties relating to the subject matter hereof. This Agreement may be assigned by Microsoft.

981328267,"老师您好，能帮我看看为什么为下面的想法是错误的呢？
以求一元线性拟合的单层神经元为例子，神经元的forward表达式为z=w*x+b，损失函数用均方差函数loss=pow(z-y,2)/2
我的思路是：
1. 先根据梯度下降公式对损失函数与z的关系进行推导，这样就能算出为了梯度下降损失值，z要怎么去变化，也就是delta_z=-eta*(loss对z的偏导)；
2. 知道z要怎么变化也就是上一个神经元的输出要怎么变化，然后反向传播给神经元delta_z，让其根据delta_z来调整自己的权重值，也就是调整w和b。具体就是神经元根据自己的表达式对w和b的偏导（delta_z/delta_w=z对w的偏导、delta_z/delta_b=z对b的偏导）来算出delta|_w和delta_b的值，然后在更新w和b的值（w+=delta_w、b+=delta_b）
之后我根据这个思路来写代码并用ch04.npz的数据来验证时结果却偏差很大，代码如下：
```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
class NeuralNet(object):
    def __init__(self):
        self.w = 0
        self.b = 0
        self.x=0

    # def backward(self,z,y,eta):
    #     delta_w=-eta*(z-y)*self.x
    #     delta_b=-eta*(z-y)
    #     self.w+=delta_w
    #     self.b+=delta_b
    #     return delta_w,self.w,delta_b,self.b
    def backward(self,delta_z):
        delta_w=delta_z/self.x
        delta_b=delta_z
        self.w+=delta_w

在**19.7.3 反向传播**中推导**正向循环的反向传播**时，公式10对中间步的计算如下：

> 对于中间的所有时间步，除了本时间步的losst回传误差外，后一个时间步的h1t+1也会回传误差：
$$
\begin{aligned}
\frac{\partial Loss}{\partial h1_t} &= \frac{\partial loss_t}{\partial z_t}\frac{\partial z_t}{\partial s_t}\frac{\partial s_t}{\partial s1_t}\frac{\partial s1_t}{\partial h1_t} + \frac{\partial Loss}{\partial h1_{t+1}}\frac{\partial h1_{t+1}}{\partial s1_{t}}\frac{\partial s1_t}{\partial h1_t}

我有一点疑问，就是本章中的双向循环神经网络的中间步并没有输出，反向计算中本时间步也并没有loss回传误差，即${\partial loss_t}$为${0}$，${dz_t}$为$0$。故公式10按下面的形式写是不是更合理一点？

问：为什么达到相同的精度，逻辑OR和NOR只用2000次左右的epoch，而逻辑AND和NAND却需要4000次以上？
答：因为逻辑OR和NOR的数据使得分类线在右上角就可以达到很好的效果，而逻辑AND和NAND在输入[0,0]时不满足要求，输入[0,1]和[1,0]时不满足要求，所以需要继续迭代，使得逻辑AND与NAND的训练次数更多。
如果我们将输入数据修改一下，修改为

`X = np.array([1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]).reshape(4, 2)`

那么逻辑OR和NOR就需要更多的迭代次数

附件内容同下：

### 感谢您的回复

#### 对于您的回复 我的一些朴素的思考

- 为什么是$z = \gamma n + \beta$ 的形式，如果使用一个全连接层呢？ 在收到您的邮件后我产生了这样的疑惑。在学习了斯坦福的一个课程CS231n“批量归一化”之后，其中一个说法给了我很大的启发: $\gamma ,\beta $ 的极限情况是 $ \gamma = \sqrt{\sigma_B^2 + \epsilon }， \beta = \mu_B $ ，然而在 $\gamma $在 等于 1 和 等于$\sqrt{\sigma_B^2 + \epsilon} $之间学习，就赋予了网络很大的灵活性，最终训练为一个对所有batch都合适的$\gamma$。（我之前错误理解为每个维度全部移动到0处，这看起来仿佛必然丧失掉数据的信息，怎么还会加快网络的收敛呢）
- 但这样或许这就和正态分布化，没有很大的关联。（？）因为我认为一个batch只有32或者64个样本的归一化，只有归一化到合适区间的效果，达不到高斯分布的大量样本的要求。不知道我的现在的理解是否正确。

#### 第二个问题

- 接上文，这就给我带来的第二个疑问，输入的数据是什么分布。我认为对于给数字的十分类，数据可以根据标签分成10份，每一份的全部数据成高斯分布，而不同份的数据之间应该没有关系。我不理解为何一开始的时候，可以对所有数据一起进行归一化处理？

#### 在推导公式的时候遇到一些问题，还烦请您看一下

##### BN层，假设X只有一个特征

$$输入\left[ \begin{matrix} 
x_1\\ x_2 \\x_3  \end{matrix} \right] \rightarrow 
归一\left[ \begin{matrix} 
n_1\\ n_2 \\n_3  \end{matrix} \right] \rightarrow
伸缩 (\gamma ) +移动(\beta)各个特征维度\left[ \begin{matrix} 
z_1\\ z_2 \\z_3  \end{matrix} \right]\leftarrow
下一层的回传\left[ \begin{matrix} 
\delta_1\\ \delta_2 \\\delta_3  \end{matrix} \right] 
$$

##### 对于前传误差公式13，**我进行了如下的推导** (符号定义沿用教程) 

$$
n_i = f_n(x_i,\mu_B,\sigma_B^2) =  {x_i-\mu_B \over \sqrt{\sigma^2_B + \epsilon}} \tag{8}
$$

$$
\mu_B =   {1 \over m}\sum_1^m x_i \tag{6}
$$

$$
\sigma^2_B = f_\sigma(x_1,...,x_m, \mu_B) = {1 \over m} \sum_1^m (x_i-\mu_B)^2 \tag{7}
$$

$$
\begin{aligned}
{\partial J \over \partial x_k} 
&= \sum_{i=1}^m {\partial J \over \partial z_i}{\partial z_i \over \partial x_k} 
\\
&= \sum_{i=1}^m \delta_i \cdot {\partial z_i \over \partial x_k}

我在学习15章<批量归一化的实现>一节中遇到困扰多日的问题，虽然是小问题，还是诚恳地希望能得到您给予的一些帮助，在此不胜感激。
- 首先，对于批量化归一，是 m个样本的第i个特征的纵向的归一化，与输入层的归一化不同。但是比如一个二分类 本来好不容易都把样本分到 0 1 两边，再次把它们集中到正态分布的中心？请问如何理解批量归一化
- 其二，对于前传误差公式13，我进行了如下的推导：(符号定义沿用教程) （本人使用vsCode中的markdow preview enhanced插件完成下面公式的呈现）
- BN层,假设样本只有一个特征
$$输入\left[ \begin{matrix} 
x_1\\ x_2 \\x_3  \end{matrix} \right] \rightarrow

575988943,"游戏最大的问题在于，平时的训练数据在赛场上，由于 bot 数不同，bot 策略不同，反而可能干扰，使程序选择错误的策略，所以其实之前训练房间的数据仅具有一定的参考价值。在策略的选取上，我们对示例程序的每一个策略进行了修改，将原本的策略进行组合，返回两个不同的数字。同时多轮测试后发现往往黄金点的数会比计算出的数偏小，所以又在该数的基础上减小 0.01，使其（比其他 bot 更贴近黄金点）。

但是目前存在的问题是，对于搅局者，不知道什么时候会出现搅局，所以在游戏同时也是训练过程中，在相同的情况下，会出现之前正反馈学习到的策略因为搅局的存在打了负分，打乱了Q表。对于这种情况，可能需要引进判断是否是极端情况，不需要学习到Q表的部分，但是这个判断也是一个难点。

#### 全员挂机去考试

写在前面：本来写了个超级简单的二层神经网络然后挂机考试去，结果

条件判断一直没进得去，就停留在了这一段代码上：

```python
 pj = sum(goldenNumberList[-10:])/10
    bzc = math.sqrt(sum([(i-pj)**2 for i in goldenNumberList[-10:]])/10)
    res2 = pj
    res1 = pj - bzc
    if res1 < 0:
        res1 = goldenNumberList[-1]*0.618
    return res1, res2
```

也就是计算前十个黄金点的平均数以及方差，然后返回平均数以及平均数减标准差。结果阴差阳错，这个算法居然跑了第二名，23333。

```python
class Net(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super (Net, self).__init__()
        self.step1 = nn.Sequential(
            nn.Linear(10, 100),
            nn.ReLU(),
            nn.Linear(100, 1),
            nn.ReLU()
        )
            
    def forward(self, x):
        x = self.step1(x)
        return x
```

这是原本pytorch写的二层感知机，相信只要接触过一点点神经网络的同学都可以写出来（也都能看出来这玩意的效果接近于瞎猜）。在此也不细讲。

我们原本考虑的是强化学习，在这给出强化学习的定义：

强化学习是一种交互式的学习方法，其主要特点为“试错搜索（Trial-and-Error）”和“延迟回报（Delay Return）”。学习过程是智能体（Agent）与环境不断交互并从环境的反馈信息中学习的过程。Agent与环境交互的过程如下：(1)Agent感知当前的环境状态（States）。

(2)根据当前的状态和奖赏值（Reward）（强化信号），Agent选择一个动作（Action）并执行该动作。

(3)当Agent所选择的动作作用于环境时，环境转移到新状态，并给出新的奖赏；(4)Agent根据环境反馈的奖赏值，计算回报值（Return），并将回报值作为更新内部策略的依据。

我们的大一新生写了一个类似强化学习的方法：

虽然有些地方可以明显的看出不合理，但还是能从中看到一些朴素的学习思想。

我在课上学过的强化学习有Q-learning、Sarsa、蒙特卡罗方法等。这三种方法都通过更新一个状态表来进行学习。

Sarsa和Q-Learning类似，但是区别是当Sarsa 和 Q-Learning处在状态s时，均选择可带来最大回报的动作a，这样可到达状态s’。而在下一步，如果使用Q-Learning， 则会观察在s’上哪个动作会带来最大回报（不会真正执行该动作，仅用来更新Q表），在s’上做决定时, 再基于更新后的Q表选择动作。而 Sarsa 是实践派，在s’ 这一步估算的动作也是接下来要执行的动作，所以 Q(s, a) 的现实值也会稍稍改动，去掉maxQ，取而代之的是在s’ 上实实在在选取的a’ 的Q值，最后像Q-Learning一样求出现实和估计的差距并更新Q表里的Q(s, a)。

因为 Sarsa 是说到做到型，所以称它为 on-policy(在线学习)，即边做边学；而Q-Learning是说到但并不一定做到，其可以通过观察别人的经历来学习，所以它也叫作 Off-policy(离线学习)。

另外，Q-Learning因为有了 maxQ，所以也是一个特别勇敢的算法，原因在于它永远都会选择最近的一条通往成功的道路，不管这条路会有多危险。而 Sarsa 则是相当保守，它会选择离危险远远的，这就是使用Sarsa方法的不同之处。

而蒙特卡罗的思想则是一种以概率统计理论为指导的数值计算方法。通常蒙特卡罗方法可以粗略地分成两类：一类是所求解的问题本身具有内在的随机性，借助计算机的运算能力可以直接模拟这种随机的过程。

另一种类型是所求解问题可以转化为某种随机分布的特征数，比如随机事件出现的概率，或者随机变量的期望值。通过随机抽样的方法，以随机事件出现的频率估计其概率，或者以抽样的数字特征估算随机变量的数字特征，并将其作为问题的解。这种方法多用于求解复杂的多维积分问题。

假设我们要计算一个不规则图形的面积，那么图形的不规则程度和分析性计算（比如，积分）的复杂程度是成正比的。蒙特卡罗方法基于这样的思想：假想你有一袋豆子，把豆子均匀地朝这个图形上撒，然后数这个图形之中有多少颗豆子，这个豆子的数目就是图形的面积。当你的豆子越小，撒的越多的时候，结果就越精确。借助计算机程序可以生成大量均匀分布坐标点，然后统计出图形内的点数，通过它们占总点数的比例和坐标点生成范围的面积就可以求出图形面积。

感兴趣的同学可以尝试一下，但是你可能依然打不过平均数。或许大道至简就是这个道理吧。

1. 首先，我们队总共设置了13个action，包括上次的黄金点，上次黄金点*0.618，上三次的黄金点平均值，上三次的黄金点平均值*0.618，上五次……等等，在我们看来，action越多越好，多多益善。留给机器选择的余地越多，分数就越有把握上去。（尽管在赛后的复盘发现，由于参赛者对黄金点的搅局，倘若只有平均值的参与，是很难得高分的，必须尝试使用标准差等等，我们组在这个点上疏忽了）

2. 我们队最开始的时候，只让机器选择一个action。然后两个提交的数，都是由这同一个action生成的。测试情况不容乐观。之后我们更改了一部分的设置，将提交数据更改为一个是action计算出的数，另一个是第一个数据*0.618，游戏测试情况提升了不少。

3. 我们刚开始同一次提交的两个数据采取的是同一个action，大大降低了效率及准确性，之后我们组尝试使每个提交的数都使用不同的action，效果不错。

4. 在赛场上发挥失误主要是由于平时我们的测试数据都是收敛的，黄金点波动不大，但是赛场上很多人都采取了扰局的策略，导致黄金点波动较大，与我们组预想的情况偏差较多。由于没有对大波动有对应之策，所以导致了失误，成绩提升十分缓慢。

5. 在微软提供的RLBotDemo，对Q-Learning的训练里，每回合的reward始终是小组每个回合得到的分数。这样就会导致一个情况：在大部分的回合里，reward始终是0，这样使得Q-learning的训练效率极为低下。所以我们更改了reward的计算机制——如果我们组的离黄金点是最近的，则reward设置为1000；如果是最远的，则设置为-1000；否则，将reward设置为500-200*abs(我们组最接近黄金点的数-黄金点)。这样会提高Q-learning的训练效果（不过赛后复盘发现这样的得分算法仍然有点问题，不应该设置±1000这样的分数，设置这样的分数反而会扰乱机器的训练）。其相关部分代码如下：

```
lastScore = 500 - 200 * min(abs(todayGoldenList.goldenNumberList[-1] - number1), abs(todayGoldenList.goldenNumberList[-1] - number2))
tmpState = 0
if len(lastRoundResp.data.rounds) > 0:
    scoreArray = [user for user in lastRoundResp.data.rounds[0].userNumbers if user.userId == userid]
    if len(scoreArray) == 1:
        tmpState = scoreArray[0].score
if tmpState > 0:
    lastScore = 1000

    lastScore = -1000
```

  比赛初期，我们采取的策略是在黄金点小于3的时候提交一个99.999进行扰动。由于只在黄金点很小时进行扰动，所以扰动对其他组的影响预期将会较大。根据我们的设想，由于黄金点游戏的误差可以看做许多量的叠加，则根据中心极限定理，该游戏误差满足正态分布。我们设非扰动值为之前黄金点的加权平均值。
  比赛后期，在发现黄金点值逐渐稳定后（即每轮变化在1左右），我们放弃扰动，当黄金点值小于4在平均值基础上减去1.3作为另一个值提交，当黄金点值大于4加上1.3提交。
  我们后期反思存在的主要问题是推导时没有考虑名次问题，如果加入参赛队伍数目，同样假设正态分布，可能会有不同的结果。
  部分代码如下：
  
    sigma = 2 if lastgoldenNumber < 5 else 0.1 #上一个黄金点小于5赋值2

    avg = avg * 0.01 * normalize + lastgoldenNumber 
    normalize = normalize * 0.01 + 1

    avg /= normalize #之前黄金点数加权平均得average值，最近一次权值最大

    s = 2 * sigma * TeamNumber * random.uniform(0, 1)

    number1 = avg

    number2 = min(avg + s, 99.999) #前半场的策略，第二个数取99.999扰动或是在第一个数基础上根据队伍数目取正态分布扰动

    if lastgoldenNumber >= 4:

        number2 = number1 - 1.3 #后半场的策略，加减1.3
