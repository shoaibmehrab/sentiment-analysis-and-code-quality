Here's a screenshot of the error given:

1925950875,"After a few days of working on this I think I finally got it working. These are the steps I did(pretty much the same as OP here but a bit different)(and I'm no expert but pretty certain some could be ran in different order, your mileage will vary i guess):

Open miniconda cmd window
Create a new env named ""spleeter""(or whatever you want to name your new env) and python 3.9 with this command: 
`(base) c:\windows\system32> conda create -n spleeter python=3.9`

Activate the ""spleeter"" env with this command:
`(base) c:\windows\system32>conda activate spleeter`

Install tensorflow(no specific version specified)(the newer version of spleeter should be compatible and/or will install the correct dependencies) with this command:
`(spleeter) c:\windows\system32>pip install tensorflow`

Install cudatoolkit(no specific version specified) with this command:
`(spleeter) c:\windows\system32>conda install cudatoolkit`

Install 'cudnn'(no specific version specified) with this command:
`(spleeter) c:\windows\system32>conda install cudnn`

Install ffmpeg/libsndfile(not totally sure if this is necessary as spleeter may automatically install but not completely sure) with this command:
`(spleeter) c:\windows\system32>conda install -c conda-forge ffmpeg libsndfile`

Install spleeter with this command:
`(spleeter) c:\windows\system32>pip install spleeter`
**note:You may get either an error or warning of certain dependencies related to tensorflow after running `pip install spleeter` but I ignored them. 

I then got an error when running a spleeter separate command regarding ""Could not locate zlibwapi.dll. Please make sure it is in your library path"". I followed this link to download the dll: https://forums.developer.nvidia.com/t/could-not-load-library-cudnn-cnn-infer64-8-dll-error-code-193/218437/16 but I did not place the file in the nvidia folder. I instead placed the file in both ""c:\windows\system32\"" and ""c:\windows\syswow64\"" and the error went away. I also used the 64bit version of the file. Not sure if its a bad idea to have placed the file in those folders but for now I am going to leave there.

Running spleeter
My test file is ~5hrs long and I'm getting OOM(out of memory) errors when running the command with the -d parameter. I tested to about 2400(seconds) and then fails and throws OOM errors. I guess there is a limitation and for longer duration the process has to be split. Of course, it could be an issue with my setup as well:
-i3
-16GB RAM
-RTX 3090
-Windows 10 Pro
For training it might also be an issue but havent gone that far yet in my journey. I am planning to at least up the RAM to 32gb soon.

Hope this helps someone.",day working think finally got working pretty much bit different expert pretty certain could ran different order mileage vary guess open window create new whatever want name new python command base create activate command base activate install specific version version compatible install correct command pip install install specific version command install install specific version command install install totally sure necessary may automatically install completely sure command install install command pip install note may get either error warning certain related running pip install got error running separate command regarding could locate please make sure library path link place file folder instead file error went away also used bit version file sure bad idea file going leave running test file long getting memory running command parameter tested guess limitation longer duration process split course could issue setup well ram pro training might also issue havent gone far yet journey least ram soon hope someone,issue,positive,positive,neutral,neutral,positive,positive

@workprintstudios can you please elaborate in more detail. I have the same output as the issue here: https://github.com/deezer/spleeter/issues/775

I followed the steps as @robertmckean showed here

This is the command I run: `spleeter separate -o D:\location\to\save\output\ D:\location\of\audio\file.wav --verbose`

When I check gpu usage it stays at 0 but cpu and RAM spike during the process. And I should mention that the audio file is 5hr long but the output only does 10mins of it(maybe a separate issue here but first want to solve the gpu issue first)

1888447821,After some trying it seems like the latest release of Spleeter on PyPI  depends on a version of numpy that will not compile with Python 3.10. It looks like this was fixed in commit https://github.com/deezer/spleeter/commit/e46aebfad94cd4bbf073952a770886809b7d9e2d but it has not been included in a release of Spleeter on PyPI (yet). It appears to install fine using Python 3.8 (which you can use `pyenv` to install in a convenient way).,trying like latest release version compile python like fixed commit included release yet install fine python use install convenient way,issue,positive,positive,positive,positive,positive,positive
1879946234,"Thanks!  

I tried:

` python3.8 -m pip install --user spleeter`
And it looks like it worked (the --user for the pip command installed it locally, not in the root directory - I think this was a permission issue; I didn't want to install with root until I got it working)
The output appeared to be OK, except lots of warnings about the installations not being in the path:

> 
> We, at Deezer, managed to use Spleeter on Mac M1 using [Tensorflow Metal](https://developer.apple.com/metal/tensorflow-plugin/). Here are the instructions you must follow in order to complete the installation.
> 
> 1. Upgrade your mac OS to Monterey (12.0.0+).
> 2. Switch to a Rosetta terminal.
> 3. Install Python 3.8. For now, we have not managed to run Metal on Python 3.9+, and Metal does not work for versions pre-3.8.
> 4. Download the `.whl` file that can be found [here](https://github.com/deezer/spleeter/files/7936622/spleeter-2.3.0b0-cp38-cp38-macosx_11_0_x86_64.whl.zip), and run the following command:
>    `python -m pip install --upgrade spleeter-2.3.0b0-cp38-cp38-macosx_11_0_x86_64.whl`
>    Note that `python` refers to your local `python3` installation. We recommend uninstalling the packages you have installed locally to avoid potential conflicting dependencies. Run the following a few times:
> 
> ```
> python -m pip freeze > requirements.txt
> python -m pip uninstall -r requirements.txt -y
> ```
> 
> 5. Test your new Spleeter installation using:
>    `python -m spleeter separate -p spleeter:2stems -o output audio_example.mp3`
>    You can check your Activity Monitor to see the GPU being used.
> 
> We have also created branch for local development using Metal. Please run the following:
> 
> ```
> git clone https://github.com/Deezer/spleeter && cd spleeter
> git fetch --all
> git checkout tf_metal
> ```
> 
> You are free to edit and update the dependencies in `pyproject.toml` and build your own `.whl` files using `poetry install` and `poetry build` ([poetry tutorial](https://python-poetry.org/docs/basic-usage/)).
> 
> Finally, please send us your feedback in the comments below. A more substantial release may follow if this fix ends up working for you!

For all those that followed these instructions and had some troubles here is what I did that got this working on my 2020 M1 Mac Mini on 13.4.1.

To get a rosetta terminal: First, open a terminal and then use command 
```
arch -x86_64 zsh
```
check with ```arch``` and the response should be ```i386``` if you are now in a rosetta terminal.

Follow the instructions quoted above to run the command to install Spleeter to your ```python``` install

Don't bother running these two commands. They just uninstall everything installed to your python install.

```
python -m pip freeze > requirements.txt
python -m pip uninstall -r requirements.txt -y
```

On my first run of the spleeter tool I had an issue where the version of protobuf that came with the whl command step was too new. So I downgraded that to 3.20.1 but you could use any stable 3.20.* version

```
python -m pip install protobuf==3.20.*
``` 

Then I was getting an error that ffmpeg binary not installed.

I installed homebrew from brew.sh in an arm64 terminal

```
/bin/bash -c ""$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)""
```
Use homebrew to Install ffmpeg with command
```
brew install ffmpeg
```
Then back in a rosetta terminal I was able to run the spleeter command successfully

`python -m spleeter separate -p spleeter:2stems -o output audio_example.mp3`

Nope. Using the tool for separating is not the same as TRAINING it. You are mixing de-mixing times and training times.
Maybe you could DEMIX 10 songs in 6 seconds.
TRAINING the model to learn to demix them is gonna take a lot more.

1526057612,"Hi,
That part is rather well explained in the wiki:
https://github.com/deezer/spleeter/wiki/2.-Getting-started

Look at the links to the .json file examples.

You need a json file that explains where to find the training data, a json file that explains where to find the validation data (about 10% amount of data compared to the training data), and of course: the data.

.wav files are fine as data, you need a .wav file with an example of a song, and two .wav files where the voice and the instruments are isolated. You need a bunch of songs like that. About 100 of them (the default Spleeter training data set has 87).

Then just run the training command from the documentation.

Where you get that training data: that's up to you to find. You can look for it on Google. I found a website called Kaggle with a bunch of datasets, but you have to go fishing and hope to find a good dataset.

If you do not find a dataset like MusDB where all the files are provided for you, you can create data, here are some things you can try, but your ability to execute them may depend on how familiar you are with music software and programs:

1) You could find an instrumental music dataset, and an a capella singing dataset and combine them to create .wav files where voices and instruments are mixed. For that you could use a script and the program ffmpeg (that you run in a terminal), here is the basic command:
ffmpeg -i instrumental_1.wav -i vocals_1.wav -filter_complex '[0][1]amix,volume=2.0' mix_1.wav

Note that the volume is doubled because the ""amix"" audio effect divides the volume by two by default, which is not desired. You would need to run that command over and over in a script and generate mix2.wav, mix_3.wav etc. Be careful that you use and generate .wav files with matching sample rates, bit depth etc. ffmpeg can convert everything for you but I leave that up to you to figure out the command, ffmpeg is well documented on the internet.

I wonder how well that approach would work: the singing will be out of key, and with a completely different rhythm, but maybe Spleeter does not care about that. Also the singing would start immediately at the beginning of the song, maybe you shouldn't train Spleeter to expect singing to be always right at the beginning, so you can delay when the singing starts (again, something ffmpeg can achieve for you, but you need to look up some commands by yourself)

2) You could buy music software  (Reason, Ableton, Native Instruments Samplers (...)) and generate 100 instrumental tracks by using music loops and their features to keep the music in the correct key and rhythm. You could then mix that with your a capella vocals. It would be some work to do this for 100 tracks, but it's not so much work that it's impossible to do. It might eat up a couple of weekends if you are already familiar with music making software. If you've never used music software before: you'll need to learn to use music software first.

Hope this helps.",hi part rather well look link file need file find training data file find validation data amount data training data course data fine data need file example song two voice isolated need bunch like default training data set run training command documentation get training data find look found bunch go fishing hope find good find like provided create data try ability execute may depend familiar music could find instrumental music singing combine create mixed could use script program run terminal basic command note volume doubled audio effect volume two default desired would need run command script generate careful use generate matching sample bit depth convert everything leave figure command well wonder well approach would work singing key completely different rhythm maybe care also singing would start immediately beginning song maybe train expect singing always right beginning delay singing something achieve need look could buy music reason native generate instrumental music keep music correct key rhythm could mix would work much work impossible might eat couple already familiar music making never used music need learn use music first hope,issue,positive,positive,positive,positive,positive,positive

So it turns out the caching features was immutable and only the first cache from the first run was used over and over. I found a workaround and now I see model.ckpt-100, model.ckpt-200 etc. get used during each iteration. It seems to be working. Unfortunately the cloud service has a limited amount of build time, so I can't use it to build for longer than I could at home.
The cloud service I use can offer me a VM with GPU to train Spleeter, but I have to pay for it. It's not very expensive I think but there is a lot of paperwork overhead, private data I must giveaway, and a bunch of automatic payment subscriptions that have to be setup before I can even try it out, and it annoys me enough to think it's not worth the hassle.
Nice to know though that you can get a GPU VM online to run the computation and not have to invest in hardware just to train Spleeter. If I ever reach a point where I have enough need for a GPU machine and am willing to spend the money and do all the private data giveaway, I might bite the bullet and do it.

1515192379,"while I using GPU to handler LARGE .wav audio file (4 hours long, ~3GB), and the defult `-d 600` will ends up Out Of Memory.
GPU: RTX 3060 LAPTOP (6BG VRAM)

1. So I set the step to 60 using [auditok](https://github.com/amsehili/auditok) to separate the file into small 60sec .wav file `0-60.wav`, `60-120.wav`, `...`
2. pass to spleeter -> `0-60_vocals.wav`, `60-120_vocals.wav`, `...`
3. use ffmepg to combine multiple wav files into one `vocals.wav`
4. hope this help

Spleeter is actually loading the full audio file at once for performing the separation, which is very memory intensive. So when you try to process a 90min files, it's very likely you're flooding the RAM of your computer.

1427127665,"Hi there. 👋 

I've done my best to adapt the steps, I took to get `spleeter` running on my machine. 

**My installation info:** 
- macOS Ventura 13.1, 8C M1 Pro
- Python version 3.10.8 
- `conda subdir osx-64` - (see **Conda env** section for more info)
- Carried out on 28th Jan 2023
- Successfully installed spleeter version **2.3.3**

**Pre-requisites:**
- You have installed and set up `conda` 
- You have installed and set up `homebrew`

Adapted From AlexanderPavlenko’s answer on: https://github.com/deezer/spleeter/issues/696

### Conda environment
Create new `conda` env (**Note**: I used tested this with 3.10, so adjust the installation as needed)

**If** you go through my instructions and they **don't** work the first time, try create a new env, re-configure it to `subdir: osx-64`, and try again.
This is assuming that your `conda` environment is configured in to run in 'ARM mode'. You can verify this by by running:
`conda config --show`. If you're in ARM mode, it'll display: `subdir: osx-arm`, if you're in x86 mode, it'll display: `subdir: osx-64`. You can change from subdir ARM to x68 at an environment level, with: `conda config --env --set subdir osx-64`

### Tensorflow dependancies for apple silicon
Install latest `tensorflow-deps` (`conda` couldn't find them by default, so I had to manually install the tarballs directly from https://anaconda.org/apple/tensorflow-deps/files (2.10.0 at time of installation)):
`conda install package.tar.gz`

Install latest `tensorflow-macos` (2.11.0 at time of installation):
`python -m pip install tensorflow-macos==2.X.X` (adjust according to need)

Install latest `tensorflow-metal` (0.7.0 at time of installation):
`python -m pip install tensorflow-metal`

Run:
`conda install -c apple llvmlite numba pandas`
(Honestly, I don't know why this step is necessary, but I followed Alex's instructions and it worked)

It may say that `tensorflow-deps` dependencies are causing an error - ignore and allow installation to proceed

### Clone spleeter repo
`cd <spleeter_env_location>`

`git clone https://github.com/Deezer/spleeter`

### Configure poetry file
`pip install poetry`

Edit `pyproject.toml` (located in cloned `spleeter` directory):
Remove: `tensorflow = ""2.X.X""`
Remove: `llvmlite` (Alex's guide specified to remove `numpy` and `pandas`, but in my experience, they were not present)
Add: `tensorflow-macos = “<version_installed>”`

### Install the d*mn thing
`python -m pip install ./spleeter`

### Finishing touches (for media encoding/export)
`brew install libsndfile` (if not already)

(Optional: `sudo ln -s /opt/homebrew/lib/libsndfile.dylib /usr/local/lib/`)

### Epilogue
If this **STILL** doesn't work for you, find Alex's original comment, and try and adapt them on your own - they are much more general than my case, and maybe a different operation will suit you best. 

Hope you get it up and running! 🙏

I'm not sure how this works. I think what it needs here is one or more complete mixes that contains everything (vocals and all instruments) in the ""mixtures"" directory, and waveform-identical mixes with everything but the vocals in the ""instruments"" directory.

How you intend to train this may not be possible, IIUC.

As I understand it, `dataset/instruments/01_foo_inst.wav` needs to be **identical** to `dataset/mixtures/01_foo_mix.wav`, except for the vocals being in `01_foo_mix.wav`, but no vocals in `01_foo_inst.wav`. I hope my understand is wrong, because it would be much easier to train if I'm wrong.

What I'd like to do, if my computer can handle it, is to record ""street noise"", and use that as ""instruments"" sources. Then add (ie, mix in together with) to those files recordings of podcasts and people talking, to use as ""mixtures"". My interest is to train a model that will separate conversations from street noise.

Looks like there's a lot of undocumented options in train.py:

`docker run -v $(pwd)/inputs:/input -v $(pwd)/output:/output deezer/spleeter:3.8 separate -o /output /input/test_audio.mp3`

The `/inputs` directory that you've added as a container volume is aliased as `/input`. Therefore, when supplying the actual input filename as an argument to the `separate` command, you would supply it as `/input/test_audio.mp3`.

This then creates an `/output` directory within your root directory with a `/test_audio` directory within it containing two separated files - `accompaniment.wav` and `vocals.wav`.",well better docker documentation way gotten separation process work via docker let say directory within root directory file root directory would run following command docker run separate directory added container volume therefore actual input argument separate command would supply directory within root directory directory within two,issue,negative,positive,positive,positive,positive,positive

@romi1502 
Thank you for your answer. 
As I understand, training data for acapella/single voice would be enough, so that no other training data would be required, because the speaker separation is done with spectogram masking. Also I think that pretrained models exist.

I found this paper [VoiceFilter: Targeted Voice Separation by Speaker-Conditioned Spectrogram Masking](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04826).
and these github implementations of that paper:
https://paperswithcode.com/paper/voicefilter-targeted-voice-separation-by
maybe you can have a look, whether this is also possible for spleeter, to utilize these libraries/implementations. 
It would be a big feature, also for the applications that utilize spleeter, I would think.

Edit:
https://github.com/Edresson/VoiceSplit
if you have a look at this colab notebook; they have a 3k hours voice separation model trained and released on github:

1235486004,"Hi @netv1,
Actually, the inputs of spleeter pre-trained models are computed from spectrograms that are computed with a 4096-sample window on signal sampled @44.1kHz. Then, only the low-frequency part of the spectrogram, up to frequency bin F, is provided as input to the model. 
The models were trained with F=512 (which corresponds to ~11kHz), and then the inputs were 512x1024 matrices. 
As the model is fully convolutional, you can actually change the size of the input at inference time. For instance, if you choose F=1024, then you'll input a 1024x1024 matrix into the model, and the first dimension of the output of all the layers will be doubled, which will just result in doubling the first dimension of the output. There is only a constraint for the downsampling/upsampling layers of the network which require that both dimensions of the input are multiple of 2^6 (6 being the number of layers). So the models are perfectly able to take as input any matrix that fits this constraint.
The question you may then ask is about the ability of the model to output correct separation masks on frequency bands it was not trained for. It turned out that the models do a pretty decent job in those bands which is not totally surprising as you may have similar frequency patterns in those bands as the ones in bands they were trained on, though the explanation for this is not perfectly clear :).

Spleeter works by estimating time-frequency masks for each instrument to be separated. To estimate those masks, it needs to estimate model spectrograms for each instrument: for instance, when you perform accompaniment/vocal separation, spleeter needs to estimate a model spectrogram for both the accompaniment and the vocal part.
So even if you only need the accompaniment, you'll need to have a forward pass in the full accompaniment + vocal model which is the most computationally intensive part.
You can save a bit of computation on 1) inverse Fourier transform of the vocal part that you don't need to compute if you only need the accompaniment 2) not exporting the vocal file. Those are not supported by spleeter as is and you'll need to tweak a bit the code.",hi work instrument estimate need estimate model instrument instance perform separation need estimate model spectrogram accompaniment vocal part even need accompaniment need forward pas full accompaniment vocal model intensive part save bit computation inverse transform vocal part need compute need accompaniment vocal file need tweak bit code,issue,negative,positive,positive,positive,positive,positive

Based on your advices, I reinstalled spleeter using the following commands : 
```bash
virtualenv -p python3 env

1153742290,"Dear @d-dawg78 , thanks for your feedback.

While protobuf related problem seems fixed, I still face problems related to a version mismatch between numba and llvmlite when using speeter v2.3.1.

Two tricks allow to fix the problem:

Trick 1: updating llvmlite

`pip install -U llvmlite`
```bash
pip install -U llvmlite
Collecting llvmlite
  Using cached llvmlite-0.38.1-cp38-cp38-manylinux_2_17_x86_64.manylinux2014_x86_64.whl (34.5 MB)

    Uninstalling llvmlite-0.38.0:

```

Alternative Trick : downgrading numba and keep default llvmlite version
`pip install numba==0.53.0`

```bash
Collecting numba==0.53.0

    Uninstalling numba-0.55.2:

## Step to reproduce

<!-- Indicates clearly steps to reproduce the behavior: -->

1. Installed using `pip install spleeter`
The installation works fine, but display the following error message : 
`ERROR: numba 0.55.2 has requirement llvmlite<0.39,>=0.38.0rc1, but you'll have llvmlite 0.36.0 which is incompatible`

3. Run as `spleeter --version`
4. Got `Spleeter Version: 2.3.1`

5. Run as `spleeter separate /pcie/test.wav`

1. In `pyproject.toml`, under `[tool.poetry.dependencies]`:
   * change `llvmlite` to `^0.37.0`
   * add `protobuf = "">3.19.0,<3.21.0""`
2. Create a new `conda` environment: `conda create -n spleeter python=3.9`. Activate it with `conda activate spleeter`.
3. Run `poetry update --lock`
4. Install some dependencies through conda-forge: `conda install -c conda-forge numpy==1.19.5 numba==0.54.1 grpcio==1.46.3 cffi==1.15.0 typed-ast==1.4.3 h5py==3.1.0 librosa==0.8.0` (Note that I grabbed the version numbers from the `poetry.lock` file, so if you're using a newer version of spleeter you'd need to change them. Poetry doesn't currently have a way to install dependencies using `conda`, sadly.)
5. Run `poetry install`
6. Test the install with `spleeter separate -p spleeter:2stems -o output audio_example.mp3`

Running `pytest`, everything passes except:

* `test_evaluate[librosa]`
* `test_separate_to_file[audio_example_mono.mp3-spleeter:5stems-librosa]`

[this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16401031/how-to-terminate-multiprocessing-pool-processes) to arrive to the solution.

So it means you could subclass `Separator` then implement an extra method that closes the pool. This seems to be able to close all processes at the end if `synchronous` is set to `True` in `separate_to_file` method, e.g.

```
from spleeter.separator import Separator

    def close_pool(self):
        if self._pool:
            self._pool.close()

separator = MySeparator('spleeter:2stems')
separator.separate_to_file(filepath, self.filedirectory, synchronous=True)

# Wait for batch to finish and terminate pool.
separator.join()
separator.close_pool()

1. Poetry installs packages from the `.lock` file. The one in your PR does not contain any installs for TF-metal and macOS.
2. When deleting the `.lock` file, the command `poetry install`, which generates the `.lock` file and installs the appropriate packages, does not work. The specific bug is:
```

For processing a single file, GPU may not bring much as most of the time is spent loading the model (which is not done on GPU).

1079661659,"Dear Bruce,

Just like you I am in the first steps of the process. My idea is to feed to
spleeter 3 versions of a performance (piano solo),(cello solo) and (piano
and cello together), I aim to train spleeter to understand whats a piano
and whats a cello and when together, it should be able to only extract
cello without losing vibrato, portamento and other characteristics.

Some studies have used 44 samples or 1h and 14 minutes such as here
https://veleslavia.github.io/conditioned-u-net/

Maybe you will find it interesting!

lets keep in touch so we can share our findings and processes!

this seems to be because pytest-forked is used instead of pytest (for making the test faster) and that pytest-forked is not supported on Windows as Windows does not provide a fork mechanism.
I then see two workaround:
* Run the test within a docker container (using for instance one of the [provided images](https://hub.docker.com/r/deezer/spleeter))
* replace ""pytest-forked"" by ""pytest"" in the pyproject.toml file (but it's unlikely that a PR with this modification will be accepted).",hi used instead making test faster provide fork mechanism see two run test within docker container instance one provided replace file unlikely modification accepted,issue,negative,negative,negative,negative,negative,negative
1072292553,"Hi @xiebruce,
For your first question, you have some information about parameters set in config files in the [wiki](https://github.com/deezer/spleeter/wiki/3.-Models). It is possibly a bit incomplete though. Regarding the instrument list, it should be set according to the dataset you want to train on. For instance with musdb, you can possibly use [""vocals"", ""instrumentals""] as you have an both instrumentals.wav and vocals.wav file for every track and that they will sum up to 
mixture.wav.

For your second question, spleeter was not made for dealing with the multi-stem format *.mp4, so you should use the multiple waveform version of musdb.
You can do a different split than the original proposed musdb one, which is only provided for algorithm comparison puposes. So if you don't plan to compare your model with other model on the test set, you can possibly use songs of the test set in your training. 

The third question concerns musdb and not spleeter, so this is not the right place for asking/answering it.

For your 4th questions, indeed you can provide only two columns if you'd like to perform 2 stems separation. As mentioned in the answer to question 2, you need to ensure that the provided stems sums up to the mix (e.g. the sum of the stems is equal to the mix). With musdb, you can do it with the `instrumentals` stem and the `vocal` stems.",hi first question information set possibly bit incomplete though regarding instrument list set according want train instance possibly use file every track sum second question made dealing format use multiple version different split original one provided algorithm comparison plan compare model model test set possibly use test set training third question right place th indeed provide two like perform separation answer question need ensure provided mix sum equal mix stem vocal,issue,positive,positive,neutral,neutral,positive,positive

I’ll review the docker images. I haven’t used docker before – I’m a ‘weekend’ programmer. My next goal is to build the project in PyCharm so I can run and modify it. I’m already failing the command line tests, so there’s something I’m missing. I’d like to hire a Python expert to Zoom call for a couple of hours to me get the program running. If you know anyone who would be interested, please feel free to forward them to me.

thanks for the help!
Note that there are also docker images <https://hub.docker.com/r/deezer/spleeter-gpu/tags>  that are supposed to work with GPUs (they were tested on linux only, not windows though).

So, last night I ran the training again on PC #1 and was hoping to provide you with a screenshot of when it hangs with the --verbose option for you to inspect, except it loaded the audio data from the musdb16hq dataset, then it continued onto creating the checkpoints..(wow great..), it never went that far.  its been going now almost 24hrs and I don't want to interrupt it. I'm not sure how much longer it will go on, but can you explain the following maybe its not too clear to me; 

  ""train_max_steps"": 200000,
    ""throttle_secs"":600,
    ""random_seed"":3,
    ""save_checkpoints_steps"":300,
    ""save_summary_steps"":5, 

I thought it would save 300 checkpoint steps x 5. Each checkpoint takes about 255sec (~4.2min), which should be about 10.5hrs of checkpoint steps until we reach 5 times, is that correct? or does it have to reach 200000 checkpoints?
If I increase the ""throttle_secs"" to 1800, will that make the process 3x faster? 

What are the strictest minimum values required to use for training the 4stems?

1050642150,"Hi @yzspku,
this is a bit more complex than that. As explained in the FAQ, the model was actually not trained on 11kHz but up to 11kHz on spectrograms computed from signal sampled at 44.1kHz (this parameter can be changed for training a system for scratch, but should not be changed at inference time).
So the idea is that input (mix) and target (separated instruments) spectrograms are computed on 44.1kHz signal, so they have frequencies up to 44.1/2 = 22.05kHz. But for memory efficiency reason, the spectrogram were trimmed at 11kHz before training. The advantage of doing that instead of processing signals sampled with a lower frequency is that it still makes it possible to perform the separation at frequencies up to 22.05kHz by extending the output spectrograms or masks (either with a post-hoc method by extending masks with the `mask_extension` parameter of the config file or just by extending the frequency reconstruction of the model by changing the `F` parameter of the config file at inference). For instance, setting F to `1536`, as done in the xx-16kHz configs, will process the signal up to 16kHz.",hi bit complex model actually trained signal parameter training system scratch inference time idea input mix target signal memory efficiency reason spectrogram training advantage instead lower frequency still possible perform separation extending output either method extending parameter file extending frequency reconstruction model parameter file inference instance setting done process signal,issue,negative,negative,neutral,neutral,negative,negative

1030660762,"Unfortunately Spleeter has some scaling issues. The preprocessing stage doesn't use the GPU at all but it does use all CPUs but unfortunately CPU utilization is very low 15-30% per core.  As far as I can tell you can't split the preprocessing from the training as it is now, so if you have a large data set you're going to waste a ton of time with your GPU idle and your CPUs will be underutilized, which is very expensive thing to do when you're paying for per hour. 

Some other things to be aware of:

Plan to have at least 2x the size of your data set for training and validation caching data. I think the real number is closer to 1.5x but I'd add a buffer just to be sure.. Running out of disk space 3 days into preprocessing and having to restart was not fun.. 

RAM utilization is much higher than I expected, I only had 12 GB available and I ran out about 4 days into preprpcessing.. Normally I would have used 64 or 128GB to be safe but I can't use that much with a GCP VM that has a GPU. Since I don't have a good way around this limit, this is pretty much a brickwall for me.. 

Yes I can reduce my training set to 1/3 but that defeats the purpose of what I set out to do. I'm not experienced enough to improve the performance of the model but I can produce a better training and validation set.

Hi @bensonjamesd <https://github.com/bensonjamesd> ,
This seems to be a pandas install issue, but this is very unclear as there is no error thrown from spleeter code.
I see in your logs, that you're using SpleeterGUI so it may be a purely SpleeterGUI issue not related to spleeter.

2) the image would not be able to take advantage of M1 features. For instance, from what I see [here](https://github.com/apple/tensorflow_macos/issues/164), you cannot install tensorflow-metal within a docker image, so that would be quite inefficient compared to a [native M1 install](https://github.com/deezer/spleeter/issues/607#issuecomment-828352392), that is not straightforward but is working quite well.
So if you have skills to build such an image, please do so and make a PR :).",hi well arm image could nice understand would build source arm could image would able take advantage instance see install within docker image would quite inefficient native install straightforward working quite well build image please make,issue,positive,positive,positive,positive,positive,positive

I've not trained a full spleeter model with a lot of data with the most recent versions of tensorflow, but I'm pretty sure you're not supposed to need that much RAM for training. So there should be something wrong in the data pipeline that causes some memory leak. The most obvious thing that could explain the issue would be caching in RAM. If you don't provide a path to the cache method of tensorflow dataset then it will cache in RAM, which in your setting is not possible (and I guess not necessary), so make sure to have filled the ""training_cache"" (and ""validation_cache"") parameters in your config file.
Otherwise, it may also be some tensorflow behavior that has changed from version 1, and that the pipeline is not handling well, and we may not be able to help on this in the short term.",hi trained full model lot data recent pretty sure supposed need much ram training something wrong data pipeline memory leak obvious thing could explain issue would ram provide path cache method cache ram setting possible guess necessary make sure filled file otherwise may also behavior version pipeline handling well may able help short term,issue,positive,positive,positive,positive,positive,positive

We, at Deezer, managed to use Spleeter on Mac M1 using [Tensorflow Metal](https://developer.apple.com/metal/tensorflow-plugin/). Here are the instructions you must follow in order to complete the installation.

1. Upgrade your mac OS to Monterey (12.0.0+).
2. Switch to a Rosetta terminal.
3. Install Python 3.8. For now, we have not managed to run Metal on Python 3.9+, and Metal does not work for versions pre-3.8.
4. Download the `.whl` file that can be found [here](https://github.com/deezer/spleeter/files/7936622/spleeter-2.3.0b0-cp38-cp38-macosx_11_0_x86_64.whl.zip), and run the following command: 
`python -m pip install --upgrade spleeter-2.3.0b0-cp38-cp38-macosx_11_0_x86_64.whl`
Note that `python` refers to your local `python3` installation. We recommend uninstalling the packages you have installed locally to avoid potential conflicting dependencies. Run the following a few times:
```
python -m pip freeze > requirements.txt
python -m pip uninstall -r requirements.txt -y
```
5. Test your new Spleeter installation using: 
`python -m spleeter separate -p spleeter:2stems -o output audio_example.mp3`
You can check your Activity Monitor to see the GPU being used.

We have also created branch for local development using Metal. Please run the following:
```
git clone https://github.com/Deezer/spleeter && cd spleeter
git fetch --all
git checkout tf_metal
```

You are free to edit and update the dependencies in `pyproject.toml` and build your own `.whl` files using `poetry install` and `poetry build` ([poetry tutorial](https://python-poetry.org/docs/basic-usage/)).

the model we released with spleeter was trained on 12s segment and does perform the separation on 12s segments (the signal is chunked in 12s segment separated and then built back by concatenation of the separated segments).
So anyway the model has to be trained on fixed size segments (possibly different from 12s, but there are constraints imposed by the model structure on the exact input size, and I don't expect much improvement by changing this parameter).
Note that you don't have to prepare short chunks for the training if you use the training code of spleeter.

So first, you need to know that if you're using the CLI, each time you're running the command, it will load the model again and includes the overhead. If you want to avoid the overhead, either separate all the file you want to separate with a single call to the CLI tool or use the python API, create a single `Separator` object and call the `separate` or `separate_to_file` method as many times as you wish.
Second, yes, `spleeter-gpu` is deprecated.

you must be aware that model downloading + loading, is a quite important overhead which for a single track will be way longer than the actual separation.
Usually, if you're interested in speed, it is because either you have several files to separate (a batch or files), or because you want your separation system to provide quickly the separated results. In both case, the overhead becomes irrelevant because you only have to load the model once.
So if you have a batch of file to process, process them all at once. Using the `spleeter` CLI, it would look like:
```bash
spleeter separate file1.mp3 file2.mp3 file3.mp3 ... fileN.mp3

It'll be quite hard for us to replicate, not having access to a windows machine with that much logical cores. Based on the logs you shared, the separation itself seems to be ok and the error only happens at the very last stage of writing the output. Now we use parallel calls with the `multiprocess` module in order to save time when writing outputs, I suppose a workaround is to deactivate the multiprocess writing (e.g. you can comment out this line https://github.com/deezer/spleeter/blob/master/spleeter/separator.py#L124). Unfortunately this is not an option that you can set from the command line at the moment.

Also it's likely that this issue pops for many other python packages using the `multiprocess` module so hopefully there's a solution to your problem out there, possibly just with setting a correct value for some environment variable.

this is very strange. Do you have the same issue on several audio files ?
@tahomi-idq, the `-d` option indeed default to 600 (=10 minutes), to avoid memory issue (memory usage is proportional to the file length, which is something we have been wanting to fix for a long time but haven't fixed yet). So setting it to 4h is indeed likely to results in strong memory usage that may overcome the available RAM. It is then quite likely that your system starts to swap heavily and explain the lag you experienced (otherwise, you'll get an OOM error). So if you need to process very long audio files, I would recommend to chop them in slightly overlapping shorter chunks (~10 min max, depending on your available RAM) before processing them.",hi strange issue several audio option indeed default avoid memory issue memory usage proportional file length something wanting fix long time fixed yet setting indeed likely strong memory usage may overcome available ram quite likely system swap heavily explain lag experienced otherwise get error need process long audio would recommend chop slightly shorter min depending available ram,issue,negative,positive,positive,positive,positive,positive

Reducing the audio quality of your input won't change the memory footprint of spleeter, as anyway signals will be resampled to 44.1kHz (in stereo).
The things that can reduce the memory footprint are the following:
* the duration of the audio: You can then chunk your audio file into small pieces so that the memory footprint is under your memory limit. Note that you can still process several files with a single call of spleeter (CLI) without affecting much the memory footprint
* the model:  
  * models separating to less stems have a smaller footprint (2stems has a lower footprint than 4stems that has a lower footprint than 5stems)
  * models that process up to higher frequencies (""<N>stems-16kHz"" models) have a larger memory footprint. This is actually handled by the `F` parameter that set the highest frequency bin up to which the model will process. Note that it has to be a multiple of 64. `F` is linearly related to the highest frequency in Hz and `F=1024` corresponds to 11025Hz.

Is VAD Voice Activity Detection? if so, sure you can use Spleeter for perfoming VAD. The easiest way would be just to operate a learned threshold on a smooth energy function of the separated vocal track. I think even such a basic setting should perform fairly.

904663860,"Hi @gazugafan,
it would be possible to generate only the accompaniment part and not the vocals one, but anyway you'll have to go through the whole model for computing the separation mask of the accompaniment (this means the model still has to estimate a vocal spectrogram to be able to estimate the accompaniment separation mask), so you won't cut the processing time in half. In particular, if you're not using GPUs, I expect the computation gain to be quite low. 
The operations you can save are the inverse Fourier transform of the vocals, and possibly the export of the audio waveform of the accompaniment (to whatever supported audio file). 
For saving on the second one, you can simply use the python API by loading and exporting the audio files by yourself to a numpy array (with waveforms sampled at 44.1kHz) and use the `separate` method of the `Separator` object (check this [WIki page](https://github.com/deezer/spleeter/wiki/4.-API-Reference#separator) for more details).

For saving on the first one (inverse Fourier transform), you'll need to tweak the code of spleeter to compute only the needed iSTFT, which could be done [here](https://github.com/deezer/spleeter/blob/master/spleeter/model/__init__.py#L479). But once again, don't expect big speed improvement, as you will save only one of three needed STFT/iSTFT computation (one iSTFT for two iSTFT and a STFT) and you won't save anything on the model computation.

I've thought a bit about this, and it looks like this would be sub-optimal:

* _""separate command builds the model each time it is called""_
* Not sure how or if the file could be processed in parallel if iterating over the input file duration.

and against Spleeter's recommendation to batch process:
* _""If you have several files to separate, it is then recommended to perform all separation with a single call to separate""_

You can possibly only process a segment of the input audio file using the `offset`(`-s`) and `duration` (`-d`) option of the `separate` command. This will results in stems of duration given by the second argument.

I'm trying to do the same, in Audacity, but haven't had much luck. It should be possible using _some_ kind of tool, since [Audo.ai](https://audo.ai/) uses spleeter and is able to remove the echo / machine / chromatic artefacts from the spleeter vocals (as observed when I tried their demo on a small clip).

Update:
It seems like the echo / machone / chromatic artefacts are not really from spleeter originally, but from the reverberation in the room of the audio recording. Spleeter simply doesn't filter it out, as the reverb also registers as the same stem (e.g. vocals). So a de-reverberation plugin to Audacity should do the job. You can confirm if this is the case for you by trying the [Acon Deverberate 2](https://acondigital.com/products/deverberate/) plugin for Audacity (it will be a demo version, where output clip will have silences inserted, and the full version is pricey).

For continuing training of a pre-trained model, you can use the `fine-tune` models available on the [release page](https://github.com/deezer/spleeter/releases/tag/v1.4.0).

You'll have to:
* download the model from the [release page](https://github.com/deezer/spleeter/releases/tag/v1.4.0).
* use a JSON configuration that looks like this (and that we'll assume to be named `4stems-finetune.json`):
```json
{
    ""train_csv"": ""training_dataset.csv"",
    ""validation_csv"": ""validation_dataset.csv"",
    ""model_dir"": ""4stems-finetune"",
    ""mix_name"": ""mix"",
    ""instrument_list"": [""vocals"", ""drums"", ""bass"", ""other""],
    ""sample_rate"":44100,
    ""frame_length"":4096,
    ""frame_step"":1024,
    ""T"":512,
    ""F"":1024,
    ""n_channels"":2,
    ""separation_exponent"":2,
    ""mask_extension"":""zeros"",

    ""validation_cache"":""cache/validation_cache"",

               ""deconv_activation"":""ELU""
        }
    }
}
```
You can then run training with:
```bash
spleeter train -p 4stems-finetune.json -d <path/to/dataset/>
```

Be sure to:
* put the model in the direction given by `model_dir` in the configuration file (namely `4stems-finetune` in the provided example)
* describe the audio samples of your training and validation dataset within the file given by  the `train_csv` and `validation_csv` in the configuration file (namely ""training_dataset.csv"" and ""validation_dataset.csv""). This must have the format of [this example file](https://github.com/deezer/spleeter/blob/master/configs/musdb_train.csv).

This filtering is done to avoid having incorrectly shaped samples, for instance mono samples in the middle of a stereo dataset, or samples with a shorter time duration than the expected size duration, that would results in an error when trying to batch samples of different shapes together.
In your case (mono 16kHz), this function filters out the whole dataset and that's why it stands out for ever.
For some reasons the number of channels of samples was hard coded to `2`, instead of taking into account the `n_channels` parameter, so all your mono samples are filtered out.

I'll have a look if we can fix this easily. In the meantime, you can:
- check if it works with 16k stereo files.
- use a custom version of spleeter by replacing the hard coded `2` value with `1` for the number of channels in `dataset.py`, but there may be some other places where stereo is hard coded.

There are only old version on the conda-forge channel but they are only compatible with python 3.7 (not 3.8).

conda create -n py37 python=3.7
conda activate py37
conda install -c conda-forge spleeter

*  If you want the latest version of spleeter or want to stay on a python 3.8 env, first make sure you have `ffmpeg` installed and then install spleeter with pip. As you already have conda installed, you can do:

conda install ffmpeg
pip install spleeter

743378306,"Hi Community,

Would like to solidly define what's needed for model management and have it reviewed by owners/community so we have a good buy-in and alignment of everyone since we'd be tackling it optimally.

There are 2 paths to progress here in parallel.
Then have it clearly documented on the main project:

### Model Management

#### 1. Short term - convert

- 1.a. Whoever got the convert done the best way we can find now - can be requested to contribute a convert to TF2 format and that could be committed for others' use.
- 1.b. It could be in a new tf2_pretrained folder and be clearly documented that it is a temp one until the long term re-train is done with a link reference to the re-train effort.
- 1.c.  Existing Projects (to revise as needed)
  - Android - @jinay1991's convert with help of https://github.com/tinoucas/spleeter-tflite-convert (https://github.com/deezer/spleeter/issues/354#issuecomment-740429543)
  - Android - @guomingjin's effort - c++ implementation with android jni project, which doesn't depend on any deep learning framework - (https://github.com/deezer/spleeter/issues/354#issuecomment-662577554)
  - iOS - @RufusMall's convers using: https://github.com/tinoucas/spleeter-tflite-convert (https://github.com/deezer/spleeter/issues/477#issuecomment-740536689)

#### 2. Long term - re-train

- 2.a. Process - ensure the process of re-train is as easy and as repeatable as possible.
    - Smaller data - a balance of a lighter weight process for dev / test that is still meaningful with reasonable quality results.  Should run on laptop in a reasonable time.
- 2.b. Re-train once and replace the earlier converted model in tf2_pretrained.
- 2.c. Set as a recurring process - not needing it too frequently - maybe monthly, ensure quality check and only replace the previous model if the result is better.
- 2.d. Cost - even if expensive - maybe being open source and good for everyone will help a company to sponsor it since it's an excellent PR.
- 2.d.  Existing Projects (to revise as needed)
  - TF2 training suggestion (https://github.com/VVasanth/SpleeterTF2.0_Unofficial)
  - TF2 Mobile example (https://github.com/VVasanth/Spleeter_Unofficial_TF20_MobileApp
  - Other ?

Copy owners - @Faylixe, @mmoussallam, @alreadytaikeune, @romi1502

Once we've revised and concluded on the best approach - we can update this ticket by @oluwabajio, and / or create tixs / update repos, as needed.

It is actually 6 times faster and correlates to the 6 cores of the cpu.  So it is likely a CPU parallelization and not a GPU one.  The gpu I got is radeon-pro-5300m with 20 Compute Units.

Just that geekbench scores confused me.  They show 6x improvement when I change from using Intel(R) UHD Graphics 630 to using AMD Radeon Pro 5300M Compute Engine.  It seems the better graphic pick forces parallelization, but that happens in reality in cpu land and not gpu land.

Unfortunate it's not accessible to use the GPU, waste of good processing units.  

And it could be too much to train on a laptop either way.

1. I am using the same pre-trained model and it worked as is without converting it to a tf2 model.
2. What I meant by this, is that it is always better to use native tf2 function to gain the advantage of the update, instead of relying on old function (`tf.compat.v1` is just a fork of the old `tf1` code).

Good that things work on iOS, and that it can be checked in parallel to Android.
Believe once we'd figure the re-train the convert older model part won't be needed.
Interesting if TFLite is mature on iOS or not yet.  Looks like we're all learning.

> The binary size inflated to 800mb or something (because it includes all the OPS via TensorFlowLiteSelectTfOps. i think I have to recompile the SelectOPS library manually to solve this on iOS), and the memory usage/performance was not great. I got around the memory usage issues by just chunking the data from the audiofile before passing it to TFLite.
> 

Appears from this and related posts and approaches I heard that chunking to very small parts is needed due to resource constraints.  And that gpu acceleration is a challenge to get to work.  Would be handy to figure both direction, OpenCL and Metal were not only highly performant on my check (on laptop) as I wrote, it was also ~5 times better than without it thus promising.  But given phone variations, even if that works on some it's going to be hard to depend on.  And chunking, is annoying to manage but important to deal w/ properly as a base.

👍

Good one to check.

> I can see there are apps out there using spleeter via PURE CoreML (bypassing tflite) which seems to be the superior solution. I have some ideas on how they might have done that - but not entirely sure since as i said I have 0 ML experience.

740536689,"I have almost 0 ML Knowledge - iOS is my domain but I managed to port a version to iOS using: https://github.com/tinoucas/spleeter-tflite-convert

and jinay1991's repository as a reference (I believe he also helped answer some of my questions). One difference was that I used the C TFLite api instead of cpp.

I've got to say TFLite for iOS support feels a bit ""beta"" for this use (though maybe it is me just doing the wrong thing).

The binary size inflated to 800mb or something (because it includes all the OPS via TensorFlowLiteSelectTfOps. i think I have to recompile the SelectOPS library manually to solve this on iOS), and the memory usage/performance was not great. I got around the memory usage issues by just chunking the data from the audiofile before passing it to TFLite.

All this to say, if you guys want to build a demo iOS app I think I am happy to help. 

One thing to note is that tflite also could not accelerate inference via GPU or neural engine, I believe someone else mentioned this was due to the dynamic tensor sizes. It might be worth keeping in mind this for future versions.

I can see there are apps out there using spleeter via PURE CoreML (bypassing tflite) which seems to be the superior solution.

@jinay1991 @VVasanth - sounds good progress, thanks.  Would like to try and collaborate on getting this out.  And will actively help if/when time allows.

For project tracking / mgmt - would progress manually merge to https://github.com/deezer/spleeter/ project when done?

740429543,"Hello @agur Thanks for your msg. We have a open feature request for the same https://github.com/deezer/spleeter/issues/477. 

With the help of [tinoucas/spleeter-tflite-convert](https://github.com/tinoucas/spleeter-tflite-convert), I was manage to convert all the existing models (TF v1.13) in a hacky way (i.e. Input/Output Tensors did not have their shapes defined in TFLite model hence `ResizeTensors` was necessary for TFLite Models afterwards and in addition to that binary for TFLite is comparatively too big due to the usage of TF_SELECT_OPS). Hence I am assuming that with retraining of the Model with TFv2 support would atleast avoid this hacky way and one could use Quantisation and Optimisation techniques to make binary smaller yet have same results.

1. Retrain and Release Models with TFv2 versions
2. Once TFv2 models are available in fact it shall be easy to release TFLite Models as well.
3. If possible, remove TF OPS and use compatible OPS between TF/TFLite OPS. [ops_compatibility](https://www.tensorflow.org/lite/guide/ops_compatibility)
4. Provide post-training quantisation for both types of models [post_training_quantization](https://www.tensorflow.org/lite/performance/post_training_quantization), this requires training dataset hence it is best is someone who is training the model provides this thing as well.

736659356,"Hi @BreezeWhite
Thank you for reporting this issue.
Indeed the mechanism for separation is a bit different between the `librosa` and `tensorflow` backend.
In the `tensorflow` backend, an infinite tensorflow `dataset` is created to feed a tensorflow `estimator` that performs the predictions. The dataset is fed with new data each time the `separate` (or `separate_to_file`) method is called. Thus there is an underlying graph for this dataset that is never closed and that may be responsible for the issue you encountered.

Note that on GPU, the `tensorflow` backend is much faster for performing separation, so it would be a pity to use the `librosa` backend instead.

I can't see a proper workaround at the moment besides what you suggested which seems to result in speed issues. Rewriting the way spleeter uses tensorflow for performing separation may actually be necessary but I can't see a better way so far. So any help on this topic would be appreciated.

This behavior is usually symptomatic of trying to separate a too long signal on a computer with not much RAM.
In this case, reducing the duration of the input signal using the `-d` option should solve the problem:

your results seem to be indeed far off what we got.
This is very hard to tell where this difference could come from without further details.
A few possibilities that come to my mind:

* there may be an issue in the last release (2.01) of spleeter that prevents proper training or separation (but reproducibilty of separation is tested in unit testing, so a problem in training is more probable). The results we reported were obtained with spleeter 1. What version of spleeter did you use? if it is spleeter 2, could you retry with one of spleeter 1 version (for instance 1.5.4) and check you still get such differences ?
* you may be using a different version of musdb. For instance, if you have corrupted files in the training set, training should run correctly (with possibly some warnings) but a part of the database won't be used which may results in lower separation performances. Can you double check that your musdb dataset is complete (100 tracks in the training set) and with no corrupted files ?

707562289,"Hi @racko1.
The behaviour you get with short buffers is not surprising. The model needs context for separating properly and may behave incorrectly at the border. With a buffer of 4096 (which is very short), you only have a single frame of STFT to process and then have almost no temporal context to perform separation.
Also be aware, that the default model (spleeter:<N>stems) will actually perform separation on 12s long segment even if you provide a shorter buffer (zero-padding the buffer to 12s), which will result in a very inefficient separation (both in terms of separation performance and in terms of speed). To change the size of the segment, you have to tweak the `T` parameter in the config. The smaller possible value is `64`  which corresponds to roughly 1.5s, so it is useless to try to perform separation on smaller buffer.

I guess you'd like to perform realtime on-the-fly separation which spleeter was not designed for.  Some compromise for doing it are discussed in issue #276 .

Thanks for your questions. I'll try to answer them:

> First of all, why use 41000 in the config (for loading/training?) when the model ins only trained to 11k?

1) This is two different things. The spectrogram model is trained until 11kHz meaning input spectrograms are cut at 11kHz, but separation can be performed until 22kHz, either by increasing the value of F at test time (this is exactly what spleeter:<N>stems-16kHz does) up to 2048 or by extending the mask averaging (using the ""average"" option for ""mask_extension"" as you mentioned). Note that models were trained with 44.1KHz, and changing the sampling rate at test time may lead to lower separation performances.

> In the FAQs you mention different configurations, but separator = Separator('spleeter:5stems-16khz') fails with spleeter.SpleeterError: No embedded configuration 5stems-16khz found. Should this work or does it only work with the command line interface?

2) `separator = Separator('spleeter:5stems-16khz')` should work but if you have a quite old version of Spleeter. I've just tested it with the most recent version and it works on my side.

> Could you add an example of how to use spleeter in Python? It took me a while to figure out how to load the data to work with separator.separate(...) (and maybe it's still wrong - see below)

3) To perform separation in python, either you do it at the file level using `separator.separate_to_file` (that behaves quite similarly to the command line) or you process directly waveforms as numpy arrays with `separator.separate`. The [wiki](https://github.com/deezer/spleeter/wiki/4.-API-Reference#raw-waveform-based-separation) provides sample code for `separator.separate` usage.

> Is the following the correct way of doing it? (Apparently not, but I don't know what else to change)

4) See 3.

Using ""mask_extension"":""average"", you should have separated signals that sum up to the mix. For older versions of spleeter (i.e. <=1.5.3), you may have differences at the very beginning or the very end of the signal due to the way STFT/iSTFT were managed, but that should be fixed from 1.5.4.

For this one, I disagree: it may make bug appear just because of updates or change of API in the dependencies. So I think it is a better practice to only consider a set of predefined versions and never use `>=`.

T = 64 is one ""jump"" in my definition, I'm not a trained english speaker.
64 spectral frames == one shot for the inference.

You can experiment yourself, the future and past doesn't matter a lot, the system is non-causal, this is the way network was trained, the left hand side and right hand side happen all at once, what you going to do is assume right hand side frame is present, so you will get real time response, which is true, but like I said the system(network itself) uses information from the left hand side contribute to the right hand side, which is the only information remain inside your real time system.

What your neural network can do when left hand side is empty(Black)?
This is why quality must drops, because there have no(or not enough) non-causal information contribute to the demixing.
This is very common you got either 1 empty stem track.

Or, what if spectral image of left hand side generates from different vocal singer?
The past spectral distribution is no more similar to present?
This happens when you change song or the song switching vocal players or any form of spectral distribution changes of specific stem track.

Your propose is no surprise works, I collect a few papers in Chinese describe Causal vs Non-causal inference for blind source separation, papers logically show result of causal frame is worse than the Non-causal one.

Quality will be worsen, since the information you use are only from the past, waste too much computation that does not contribute to the output.
The CPU usage will going to be impractical, approximately, 20 minutes processing time for 1 minute song on CPU. 1 minutes processing time on GPU for a 3 minutes song.

In the training phase, spleeter caches input and output spectrograms to disk to avoid recomputing them at each epoch, so you need enough disk space to store all your dataset spectrograms (which can be big, depending on the size of your dataset). 
You can avoid caching by not setting ""training_cache"" in the JSON config file, but be aware that it will be very inefficient make training much longer so it is definitely not an acceptable solution.
Another solution would be to take spectrograms computation out from the tensorflow dataset pipeline and to perform the spectrograms computation on GPU (which would add a bit but limited amount of overhead) but it is not implemented in spleeter and will require some extra work.

657373193,"So, like I’ve said, I don’t own that software and I’m only speculating,
chopping up the song into smaller pieces and processing only the parts
relevant to where you’re at in the timeline surely will feel like
instantaniously.

It’s not rocket science.

If 3 minutes take you 10 seconds to process using Spleeter on the cpu, that
would be 18x faster than realtime, so while DJing you’re probably looking
at 2.5s before and 2.5s after the transport position.

So 5s in total to process through spleeter would take  0.27 seconds, and
that will feel like instant.

652516231,"Hi @geraldoramos,
thank you for the detailed issue.
Yes there is indeed an issue at the beginning of reconstructed signals. This is due to a strange behavior of the STFT of tensorflow that spleeter does not compensate: the first window of the STFT starts at the first sample while it should be centered on the first sample. To compensate for that, we should pad the beginning of the input of the STFT with zeros and remove the padded portion after separation. 
This is usually not a big deal if you process a full track (as songs commonly have already a bit of silence at the beginning).I'll have a look for a quick fix on this aspect of the issue.

That being said, even after solving this first problem, you'll still have troubles at borders if you try to process chunked segment of audio without doing overlap: this is inherent to STFT processing with overlap and add reconstruction. The result of the first chunk can actually leak a bit on the next chunk and if you don't take this into account, you may still have glitches. So if you want no glitch, you need to do a bit of overlap between your chunks (which, by the way, will solve the first problem too).",hi thank detailed issue yes indeed issue beginning reconstructed due strange behavior compensate first window first sample centered first sample compensate pad beginning input remove portion separation usually big deal process full track commonly already bit silence beginning look quick fix aspect issue said even first problem still try process segment audio without overlap inherent overlap add reconstruction result first chunk actually leak bit next chunk take account may still want need bit overlap way solve first problem,issue,negative,positive,positive,positive,positive,positive

I can notice when transitioning from 30-31seconds that audio has a hiccup. This is exactly the same gap I found in my experiments. It's more noticeable if it's music and if you mix all the processed stems and play it like the original.

Looks like this extra space is being added by Spleeter. I've tried splitting a song in 30 seconds chunks without the Spleeter part and connecting it back using sox and FFmpeg, using wav files. For those, I see perfect stitching without this mini gap. This makes me think that Spleeter processing is somehow adding this very small padding at the end of each steam.

I'm always using lossless files (wav) everywhere during these tests so it will prevent the things @mickdekkers pointed out.

Let me know what you think.

645406879,"Hi @CHJ85 

Let me just rephrase my answer in a clearer way. Since *spleeter* is based on tensorflow1 , we cannot yet release a python3.8 compatible version. We are quite aware of this and made it clear from the [Readme](../Readme.md) and the [Documentation Wiki](https://github.com/deezer/spleeter/wiki/5.-FAQ#python-38). Working on a TF2 port is our long-term solution but also quite time-consuming.

To run *spleeter* you will then need a sandboxed python3.6 or 3.7 on your system. We provide many solutions for that through:
* `pip` (yes you'll have to run it in a 3.6/3/7 virtualenv if your systems' python is 3.8)
* `Conda` which remains the recommended way to install *spleeter*. It has some drawbacks but at least it is a **cross-platform** solution that is widely adopted by researchers and developers
* and `Docker` images pre-built and ready to deploy and use

I'm genuinely sorry if you did not manage to have any of these working, and you can always **constructively** open an issue ticket reporting what the problem is and we will help you solve it.

We have no plan to add support for platform-specific package managers. Maintaining the current solution is already a challenge.

Though if the SFX are identical in both the ""fullmix_path"" and ""other_path"", this really shouldn't make a difference? This could total by the reason I'm having trouble, It would be great to have a second opinion on this too.

In terms of LR having dialogue. I was very particular about the sources I chose, and screened the other channels (obviously only a random sample) of the LR/BR channels and they don't have any dialogue bleed in them. Note: Often films and shows with no clean centre channels do put vocals in the other surround channels as well, I am not sure why, as they are so quiet, it barely makes a difference. 

Right now, for step one I'd settle on figuring out why:

- My model takes under a minute to train when there is 90 hours of data. This seems very suspicious.
- Bonus points: if anyone can suggest a way to split a whole film file (~2h20m) using `spleeter:2stems`, spleeter seems to have issues with this, and it doesn't seem to be memory related as other posts have indicated.",think would hard improve lot welcome prove wrong impress would could significant amount one trained purpose film would little specific possibly better specific application used model weird audio silence dialogue sometimes music spoil model also sometimes messing training interesting one channel music also though identical really make difference could total reason trouble would great second opinion dialogue particular chose screened obviously random sample dialogue bleed note often clean put surround well sure quiet barely difference right step one settle model minute train data suspicious bonus anyone suggest way split whole film file seem memory related,issue,positive,positive,positive,positive,positive,positive

If you want an alternative, there's https://github.com/facebookresearch/demucs which is FULL bandwidth , but it has the same flaw as spleetter , ie, crashing on long files.

Song spleet time:  2.27 s

I am not sure about what exactly caused the 200ms error for me. I was suspecting ffmpeg being inaccurate when splitting and joining, but I don't really know. Anyway, the resulting stems are totally acceptable.

I remember coming across an issue that mentioned differing input and output durations. Perhaps [the answer given there](https://github.com/deezer/spleeter/issues/96#issuecomment-554115658) might also apply here?

> Small variations of duration between WAV and MP3 versions of a signal are not uncommon and are probably just the result of some padding of zeroes to fit the length to a multiple of the MDCT size.

I haven't inspected the source code, but it could be that Spleeter performs some format conversion implicitly. Are the input files you tested MP3? The difference in duration documented in #96 was about 30ms, which is quite a bit less than 200ms. Still, perhaps splitting the audio exacerbated the effect. This is just a semi-educated guess, I'm no expert 😉

633155556,"Since this didn't get out of my mind, I did the tedious fighting with bash and ffmpeg...

The result is:
You can feed an audio file of any length into the script and the whole process is not going to eat more than 2GB RAM. I think for me it was around 1.6GB.

How it works:
- Split the audio file into 30s parts. 
- Process them all with spleeter. 
- Join the resulting stem-parts to the full-length stems. 
- Split the audio file again into 30s parts but with the first part being only 15s long. 
- Process them again with spleeter. 
- Join the results to full-length stems again. 
- Replace 3s around every crack in the first stems with the respective 3 seconds from the second stems.
- clean up.

Downside:
- Processes the audio twice with spleeter
- The result is not 100% accurate: on a 3m30s track the stems were around 200ms too long.
I am not sure about what exactly caused the 200ms error for me. I was suspecting ffmpeg being inaccurate when splitting and joining, but I don't really know. Anyway, the resulting stems are totally acceptable. 

Use the script by putting your audio file in the same folder and calling `./separate.sh audio.mp3`. You might need to comment out the first two lines depending on your conda installation.

You need to pass the same json file that you used for training your model to the `separate` command.

Note that the `model_dir` parameter in the json file indicates where the model checkpoint (where are the model weights) will be stored. If you use a relative path, be sure you run the `separate` command in the same directory as you ran the `train` one.

632679011,"Hi @JavaShipped 
> Is Spleeter training a model using the train.csv and then taking some other, similar (not the same) data/music and comparing it?

Spleeter does train the model using the train.csv and then regularly computes some metrics on the validation.csv. The metrics on the validation.csv aim at monitoring the ability of the model to generalize to unseen data (so it has to be different data). Checking these metrics can help detecting possible overfitting of the model.
This is a very common setup in general machine learning.

> If so, this means that none of the data can be shared between the two csv files, correct?

Exactly, otherwise, you won't monitor the ability of your model to generalize to unseen data.

> So as a simple example, I could use the first 3 Foo Fighters Albums to train a model, and their most recent one to validate?

Well if your goal is only to separate Foo fighters songs in the end, it may be sufficient. 
But, if you want your model being able to generalize to other bands (with other singers, other musicians, recording in other studios...), you'll need to put other bands song in the validation set to monitor it.
So it is also usually recommended to ensure that no artists appears both in the training set and the validation dataset (and the same for the test set), to avoid over optimistic metrics. By the way, this is not only valid for source separation but for any machine learning task. See for instance ""A Closer Look On Artist Filters For Musical Genre Classification"". Arthur Flexer, ISMIR 2007.

-->I can only comment on your third question:  A model’s ability to recognize the individual patterns in the albums from its dataset will be governed by how similar or dissimilar the new information it is receiving is.  In other words, music that has been mixed similarly will produce the best results.

627882003,"I think that trying to do multi-threading on top of the tensorflow session won't work properly and will results in deadlocks.
If the goal of having separation in parallel is to be faster, be aware that tensorflow already does a fairly good job at using multiple core (and this is not controlled by the `multiprocess` parameter which only deals with parallelizing audio export).
I realized that the model is actually reloaded at each separation (when using the librosa backend, not with the tensorflow one) which is sub-optimal. 
I made a fix in [this branch](https://github.com/deezer/spleeter/tree/avoid_multiple_restore_librosa) that avoid reloading the model and should make multiple separation faster (with the librosa backend). 
It also makes it possible to instanciate several Separator objects (while it is not recommended to do so as it will add a lot of overhead compared to calling several time the `separate` method of the same object).

627361398,"Hi @JeffreyCA ,
This is a know issue that comes from the current design of the `Separator` object. 
Actually, the `Separator` object was not designed to be instanciated several times: if you need to perform several separations with the same config, you only need a single `Spearator` and run several times the `separate` method on it. 
Then, instantiating it only once should solve your issue:
```Python
from spleeter import *
from spleeter.separator import Separator

    audio_adapter = get_default_audio_adapter()
    waveform, _ = audio_adapter.load('test.mp3', sample_rate=44100)
    separator.separate(waveform)

separator = Separator('spleeter:4stems', stft_backend='librosa', multiprocess=False)

Subject: [deezer/spleeter] [Bug] ffprobe error: No such file or directory (#364)


Description

still trying to get spleeter to stop being a fickle piece of shit. every time i enter the command it keeps saying ""No such file or directory"", and it keeps confusing the audio file as a directory,, thinking that the audio file dosen't exist, which is bullshit.

Step to reproduce

run python -m spleeter separate -i C:\Users\smcco\Music\Power Rangers Time Force Theme.mp3 -p spleeter:5stems -o output

  1.  Installed using Conda
  2.  Run as regular user
  3.  Got spleeter: error: unrecognized arguments: o- output

Output

(base) C:\Users\smcco>python -m spleeter separate -i C:\Users\smcco\Music\Power Rangers Time Force Theme.mp3 -p spleeter:5stems -o output

sounds good. As we use stempeg in many other projects it would be great if we could discuss the API for this first in https://github.com/faroit/stempeg/pull/28 before we continue here.

exactly. Maybe this could be made a bit more abstract by adding `stream_map` classes that users could provide. Eg. `stream_map = stempeg.map.multichannel` for multi-channel, `stream_map  = stempeg.map.files(['mix', 'drum', ...])` for `streams_as_files`... ?

> Also I notice that in your implementation you're not writing the outputs in parallel as we do, is there any reason for that ?

indeed, that would be simple to re-add for the `streams_as_files` but I don't think it would make sense for the stems format as this is not iterating over the stems - hence there is no speed benefit.

Did you really get much speedup for multiprocessing on write?

We've been looking at your proposal and here's our take on it:

* However, a lot of our users are accustomed to the fact that separated tracks are written as multiple files in the output and not multichannel ones.

This is not possible at the moment as Spleeter models were trained to discriminate vocals (being lead or background) from other instruments.
If you have a dataset with background vocals separated from the lead vocals (for instance background vocals included in the accompaniment), you can try training a Spleeter model with it.
However, separating lead from background seems quite a challenge, and I won't be surprised that a model trained on such a dataset in the spleeter training fashion would struggle at doing such a task.

620078199,"Hi @dimdog,
`ret = np.fromstring(in_data, dtype=np.float32)` returns a NC long 1D numpy array (with interleaved channels) while `Separator` needs a NxC (2D) numpy array, where C is the number of channels and N the number of samples per channel. The number of channels needs to be equal to 1 or 2 and note that, in both cases, the separator will output stereo waveforms.
So you need to reshape properly the `ret` array.

Also, be aware that:
1) separating on very short audio snippets (here, you use 1024 sample long audio snippets) will results in very poor separation performances and in very inefficient computations (since anyway the separator will pad the audio to process 12s long segments). You need to take much longer snippets (at least at the order of 1s), which leads to the second point.
2) you seem to want to perform separation realtime, while spleeter is not designed for that. Taking sufficiently long segment (which is needed) will result in quite large latency.

620074199,"@alreadytaikeune Yes I am using spleeter 1.5.1, which has #319's changes. It seems to happen when performing separations sequentially or when more than one separation is taking place at the same time.

You can see for yourself with this example:

```py
from spleeter import *
from spleeter.separator import Separator
from spleeter.utils import *
from spleeter.audio.adapter import get_default_audio_adapter

    waveform, _ = audio_adapter.load('test.mp3', sample_rate=44100)
    separator.separate(waveform)

for i in range(3):
    func()
```

I am developing an app that does something similar to this, with multiple threads or processes consuming separation tasks off a queue. Moving `Separator` initialization outside also has its problems.

```py
def func():
    for i in range(3):
        separator = Separator('spleeter:4stems', stft_backend='librosa', multiprocess=False)

Instead of having:

""validation_cache"":""validation_cache"",

Try this:
""training_cache"":""cache/training"",
 ""validation_cache"":""cache/validation"",

If that doesn't work, then you can try to make sure your dependencies are the right version. I noticed that even though I installed the latest spleeter through Conda, it installed tensorflow 1.14.0.
If your tensorflow or any other dependency doesn't match what is in the requirements.txt file, then install it by running a command like this:

pip install tensorflow==1.5.2

more generally:
pip install [Package_Name]==<version#>

I'm now facing another problem though. I can now train a new model completely fine, but when I try to fine tune a model and have the model_dir point to the  2stems-finetune folder that is provided from the releases page, the training immediately exits.
The output is:
INFO:spleeter:Start model training
INFO:splleter:Model training done

And the output is immediate, so I know no training has occurred. It's strange because I was able to fine-tune before, I did once about three weeks ago.

EDIT: Sorry about such a long post, but I fixed my issue.
In my json file I had this line:
""n_chunks_per_song"":1,

616830743,"Hey @romi1502, I tried it again with these steps:
1. I tried with the default code and it worked! 
2. When I added my own  [sample song](https://github.com/welpdx/200417_RandTest/blob/master/aaa.mp3) into the code, that error showed up again.
3. I then undid all code back to the original and trying the process with the example audio, to get me the exact same error (now with the example audio). This basically replicated the error above and was what originally prompted me to post this bug report. 
4. Factory reset fixed.  Did step 1 again, all went fine. 

I guess my main question is what is wrong with my [sample song](https://github.com/welpdx/200417_RandTest/blob/master/aaa.mp3)?
The only thing I noticed was different with the example was that my song won't play at `Audio('aaa.mp3')` and  `!wget` [finds the song to have](https://i.imgur.com/E0ZcJ6M.jpg:)  `Length: unspecified [text/html]`.

I also tried `!wget https://github.com/deezer/spleeter/raw/master/audio_example.mp3 --ignore-length` hoping that this will replicate the error. Nope, with `Length: ignored [audio/mpeg]`, `!spleeterr` still executed fine. 


tl;dr
There's nothing wrong for the default code for audio_example.mp3. But the above error shows up for [my song](https://github.com/welpdx/200417_RandTest/blob/master/aaa.mp3).

We don't really have enough resources to start and maintain yet another communication channel around this project, so the Discord is not going to happen anytime soon, at least not hosted by us.

To @Richard3234sa thanks for this very constructive feedback. A quick reminder though: this is a free, open-source project, not a software you bought.

I followed @romi1502 's suggestion and successfully implemented a very simple volume control VST3 plugin running in real time with spleeter !
You can find the plug-in code right [here](https://github.com/gvne/vstSpleeter). I also provide a pre-build for OSX (tested on 10.14 and 10.15) [here](https://github.com/gvne/vstSpleeter/releases/download/v0.1/vstSpleeter-v0.1.zip). 

As expected the latency is the worst. 64 frames for spleeter and a couple of extra frames to leave enough time for the process to run properly (setup to 10 on the pre-built if I'm not mistaking). That leads to a latency close to 2seconds... But still, playing with those sliders is so much fun ! 😃

As a side note, I didn't release a new spleeterpp version that includes the on-line processing yet (the code is available in the develop branch though). I still need to update the documentation with details about the algorithm. There are quite a few parameters after all. I also need to assert the equality with the classic process.

Short answer: Source separation is hard :)

Since we don't know your data it's impossible to say what's possibly going wrong or not. You may want to analyze your learning process, specifically whether it[ overfits or underfits](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/keras/overfit_and_underfit) your training data.  If your dataset is not so large, it's also probably to fine-tune an existing pre-trained model rather that trying to train from scratch.

Finally, don't hesitate to evaluate your trained model on public datasets such as musdb. In any case, look for the file where the separation results are not good and try to understand why (mixing conditions ? unbalance of this genre in your dataset ? ...)

Also looking at the Spleeter source code, it implies that multiple machines can be used to train a model.

What I wonder now is why multiple machines before taking full advantage of multiple GPU's,
unless multiple GPU's in multiple machines are present.

Either way I'd love if the Spleeter devs would address this as it would greatly benefit the community.

> You can change the size 'T' at test time as long as it remains a multiple of 64

Well, I surely didn't get that ! I was sure it was a training parameter that configured the network input size. My bad. At least it means I don't need to retrain the models which is a very good news. Those AWS GPU instances aren't cheap...

> If you want to go below T=64, you'll need both to retrain the system and to change the architecture of the network (reduce the number of layers) and you won't be able to take advantage of the data we used for training.

That matches what mmoussallam said on gitter. I'll keep that option for later. I'm no Deep Learning expert and that's not what I was expecting to do when I started the project.

> What I would recommend is to perform overlap and add with a short T that does not need retraining (for instance T=64). You would then process 1.5s of the past audio and just output the as short as you want current frame of audio, the size of which would be mainly set by the computation power of your system. Do you have an idea of a many T-long segment you can process per second ? (note that doing STFT/iSTFT outside tensorflow may make things faster on CPU).

I'll try that out ! I think that it's the right first step anyway. 
I'll keep the T and overlap rate between windows of T frames as high level parameters. I want that tool to work on any machine so I can't really force a user into using a specific setup.

590460321,"Hi @gvne!

First, be aware that you don't necessarily need to retrain the system. You can change the size 'T' at test time as long as it remains a multiple of 64 (which corresponds to 1.5s). That will change a bit the performances especially at the segment borders, but if you want to do realtime separation (then causal separation), you won't be able to take advantage of the future audio samples in anyway and then you'll need to cope with it. 
You can evaluate straightforwardly spleeter with shorter T by just updating the corresponding config json file.

If you want to go below T=64, you'll need both to retrain the system and to change the architecture of the network (reduce the number of layers) and you won't be able to take advantage of the data we used for training. And I suspect that you may not be able to use much shorter segments without strongly degrading separation results.

Do you have an idea of a many T-long segment you can process per second ? (note that doing STFT/iSTFT outside tensorflow may make things faster on CPU).

Regarding your questions:
1) the validation_csv is used for monitoring validation cost. While it has no impact on the final model (there is no early stopping mechanism), it is useful to check that your model is not overfitting (which would results in a validation cost going up at some point). The easiest way to visualize it is to use tensorboard.

2) Training is quite intensive. 4 hours for 100000 steps does not seem that much to me. You can monitor the GPU your using to make sure it is actually well exploited.

3) The evaluation system is not supposed to be broken. I need to check it then :).

Thanks for the calculations above.  I am assuming that the ""number"" in the model.ckpt-XXXX.data-00000-of-00001 needs to get to the max steps defined in the JSON.  If so, it looks like it will take about 20 days.

This doesn't make sense to me.  I would have thought the processing time would be dependent on the number of training files.  It doesn't appear to.

Hi @farsdewibs0n , @Mixerrog

The standards and finetune version are, in fact, the same model. The difference is that if you want to fineture (that is to say, keep training over the existing model parameter on your own dataset) it turns out the standard models where lacking some info and tensorflow was not able to pick up on it and initialize training from it.

So for the inference part (separating your sources) there is absolutely no difference between the models, but if you want to finetune it on your data you will need the finetune version.

Hope this answer your question

I assume the finetune models would be preferred for training as they are much larger files so in theory should give better separations. You can download them at the website https://github.com/deezer/spleeter/releases  I was able to get them to work I think in version 1.49 by substituting these new finetune files for the training files inside each of the stem's training folders but I think there might be an error in how the program is running as per my issue #232, they answered that version 1.49 should download these finetune stems the first time Spleeter version 1.49 runs but as I said it did not for me.

I then did stem comparisons using the older training files compared with the new finetune training files and found no difference at all so still not sure if the program is using them or using them correctly?  I did phase inversion addition of each of the 2 stems obtained (2 for each of vocals, drums, bass & other) and they all cancelled which proves no difference between using the 2 different training bases which I would have thought there should be?

in audio/ffmpeg.py I changed line 108 from

Discordance mentioned the BEAN dataset, that contains:24,097 songs
79 hours of audio stems
majority of pop/rock songs

Is it being used by the latest Spleeter version or is there a way to download &use it for the training files if not?

Thanks, Roger

Hi,
with the current version, setting the bitrate seems to work correctly:
spleeter separate -i audio_example.mp3 -p spleeter:5stems -b 320k -c mp3 -o splits
This command outputs mp3 audio files with bitrate 320kpbs.
Be sure to use the -c mp3 option to get the output in mp3. Without the -c option, the default output file type is wav, with PCM encoding, for which the -b 320k option has no effect.

We have found that using

```python
tf.reset_default_graph()
tf.keras.backend.clear_session()

after every call to `estimator.predict` seems to free up some memory, so the leak is still there, but ti works better:

and
`elapsed_time = now_time - start_time`

3. Install Anaconda
4. Remove all spleeter related files in `c:\users\username\anaconda\pkgs\` and `C:\users\username\anaconda\Lib\site-packages`
5. Open Anaconda shell
6. Remove Conda environments using the following commands:
```conda remove spleeter
conda remove spleeter-cpu
conda remove spleeter-gpu
conda remove --name spleeter --all
conda remove --name spleeter-cpu --all
conda remove --name spleeter-gpu --all

7. Remove git clone of spleeter in your project folder, wherever you've put it
8. Run `conda install -c conda-forge spleeter-gpu`
9. Run `pip install -r config.txt`
10. Verify by running `spleeter separate -i ""input.mp3"" -p spleeter:5stems -o ""output""`

> **Why are there no high frequencies in the generated output files ?**
> 
> Modeling sources in high frequencies is very hard. In the pre-trained models, Spectrogram are learnt up to 11kHz only and when separating, the default mask extension (above 11kHz) is set to 0, which means that all frequencies above 11kHz will actually be discarded in the separated files.
> 
> There is actually an option to change this default behaviour: the mask_extension option can be set to zeros (default) or to average (see the wiki). The latter extends the mask values to the average value of the masks under 11kHz, but be wary that it generates some interferences in the high frequencies.

Here is a detailed discussion of the issue. #2 

What I understand is that Spleeter is not learning from frequencies above 11khz, hence that section is discarded, but there are workarounds that will disable this automatic cutoff, mentioned in FAQ and the thread.

565428981,"Hello @LucasThompson, glad to hear I'm not the only one using this method.  

For large input, I was thinking about concatenating chunks by processing extra samples on the edges  and using a cross fade on overlapping sections to avoid discontinuities. But that would probably give a different result than processing the whole file. Not sure if that would be significant though. I'd be happy to read it if you get a chance to test it.

That being said, I agree it would be great to be able to work on STFTs rather than waveforms. It would avoid computing them twice when you want to chain the extraction with a frequency domain filter.  
I see there is a `mix_stft` input when checking the saved model. Maybe adding the `vocals_stft` and `accompaniment_stft` won't be too much of a problem.

565379772,"I have also been working on this. I have separately got about as far as @gvne, and took a very similar approach - though was using the lower level `libtensorflow` C API, having exported the estimator in the SavedModel format. Nice to know we are on similar paths.

Passing off the entire audio file for inference uses far too much memory for this to be usable in production, and we need to take an approach of exporting a subgraph I feel so that we can feed it in a streaming fashion similar to the training network.

Though, I have been wondering - would it be possible to just pass smaller chunks of audio to the network and let it do the STFT internally, and then stitch the output together (probably in a streaming fashion, out to a file). Or, would this yield different results? I've not thought it through, and might experiment. @alreadytaikeune do you think this would work?

If you want to do this, then you need to also create ""mixes"", that is drum loops from which you want to learn. 

basically the idea is that in order to train on a separation task, you need the ""mix"" (the drum loop) and all the isolated parts that have been used to create the drum loop.

It probaly means you need to create this training dataset by creating drum loops yourself (I guess you can automatically generate them).

I was thinking about an XML file or similar that describes the names of the input and output tensors to use for STFT input and instrument masks output. That way it would be very easy to exchange the model.

I did manage to load the models in TensorBoard and examine them, however, the graphs are a bit intimidating. I’ve also tried to “freeze” the pretrained model using the “freeze_graph” command line tool. First I had to create a .pbtxt that describes the graph (using the write_graph command). The freeze_graph lets us specify on or more output nodes, so that in theory, it should be possible to get the masks. I thought I could use the STFT from the graph and simply resample audio on demand and feed it to the graph. Here’s the command line I used:

freeze_graph --input_graph=""2stems.pbtxt"" --input_checkpoint=""2stems/model"" --output_graph=""frozen.pb"" --output_node_names=""conv2d_13/Sigmoid, conv2d_6/Sigmoid""

The above is for the 2stems model and as far as I can understand the “conv2d_13/Sigmoid” and “conv2d_6/Sigmoid” nodes contain the masking for voice accompaniment and voice respectively.

561566267,"Hi @divideconcept , you can convert the pb file into an event file that you can then analyze using tensorboard. This will allow you to see exactly which tensors correspond to what you want to define as inputs and outputs. You can then use these names to export a subgraph that only deals with spectrograms.

You can use the following snippet to create the event file. `model_file` is something like `2stems/model.data-00000-of-00001`, and `log_dir` is the directory where to write the event file.
```
with session.Session(graph=ops.Graph()) as sess:
    with gfile.FastGFile(model_file, ""rb"") as f:
      graph_def = graph_pb2.GraphDef()
      graph_def.ParseFromString(f.read())
      importer.import_graph_def(graph_def)

    pb_visual_writer = summary.FileWriter(log_dir)
    pb_visual_writer.add_graph(sess.graph) 
```
As to the last part of the question, although you can run the separation model for all values of `freq_bin_max` that are multiple of 128, it is quite unclear what the performances will be since the same bin index in the input spectrogram will not correspond the the same frequencies anymore, and increasing the resolution of the spectrogram modifies some characteristics like the sharpness of the peaks. It is therefore hard to predict how the model will behave in this setting. You can try it though!

561547371,"@alreadytaikeune , first of all, thanks to Deezer for releasing Spleeter with such a permissive license! I'm also very interested in this. A .pb file that takes the STFT as input and outputs the instrument masking weights for each stem would be great. Unfortunately, I don't have any experience with TensorFlow, but as far as I understand, this involves ""freezing"" the graph and specifying the right input and output nodes, right? I think it could be interesting for all parties to agree on a format so that these models could be embedded into the commercial tools available. This would make it easier for end-users to use and we could add some additional features for comfortable use, such as background separation to make it seem like a real-time operation.

Yep, I understand the inverse transform part and what's needed to properly stitch the audio segments.

Actually the most mysterious part to me now is step 5. : is there a way to convert your set of meta/index/data files into a .pb file that would take a 512x1024x2 block as an input, and would output several 512x1024x2 blocks ? When I look at the structure of the provided models, even in their meta/index/data form it seems they are already structured to take a waveform as an input instead of a spectrogram.
Any tip on how to input a spectrogram instead (and get spectrograms in return) would be appreciated!",hi thanks confirming yep understand inverse transform part properly stitch audio actually mysterious part step way convert set file would take block input would output several look structure provided even form already structured take input instead spectrogram tip input spectrogram instead get return would,issue,negative,positive,neutral,neutral,positive,positive
561196574,"Hi @divideconcept. In the .pb files we are exporting and that you can integrate in your app using the c++ tensorflow API, all the operations you list are already included. When you load the graph in your app, you only need to care about feeding it the raw waveform as (-1, 2) shaped float32 array. You will get the stems as output. You can check the content of the graph with tensorboard.

That being said, if you want for some reason to do the DSP part yourself and only use the Unet part of the graph, then yes, you are definitely on the right track. Just make sure in step 7 to also apply Hann windowing when computing the inverse Fourier transforms. When reconstructing the raw audio, mind the overlap between windows. It is actually a STFT you are inverting. You will need to divide the result of summing the overlapping frames by 1.5 to account for the two Hann windows and the overlap of 1/4th. Depending on the implementation of the inverse transform you might also need to divide the raw audio you get after inversion by the window length.

Hope that helps.

Ah! Yes, that worked for me as well. Was pulling my hair out as I had it working a week ago and then it didn't for some unknown reason. Finally reinstalled everything, did the force-reinstall and I'm back in business again.

For what it's worth, the first time I ran the 'separate' command, I got a different error:
FileExistsError: [Errno 17] Cannot create a file when that file already exists:
'audio_output\\audio_example'

but just running it again, both stems were created.

Well, the initial goal was to provide an ""easier"" installation method for non tech people. The shorter the better, and having a command line which is path / location agnostic is always better for someone who discover a terminal for a first time than a file based approach.

> `n_chunks_per_song` is set to 1. Shouldn't this be larger for full tracks like in MUSDB?

Yes, it should be set to something bigger for musdb. This is the total number of 20s (could be set by parameter chunk_duration) audio chunk used for training (a sub 12s segment is then randomly crop within these chunks). Chunking is used to ensure efficient spectrogram caching while keeping some randomness in the selected segments.
For musdb, I would recommend setting to a value between 20 and 30 to have a good span of each track, otherwise you only train the model on 20s of each track which is very small.

> `random_time_crop` is using a fixed seed which is not updated during training. That means the chunks are deterministic and therefore only a very small fraction of the MUSDB18 dataset is actually used in training.

I don't think so. As `random_time_crop` is called several times in the same tensorflow session (the one used for training), each call should lead to a different random crop. Seeding just ensure, that the sequence of cropping value is the same in a session. Feel free to correct me if I'm wrong :).

> `train_max_steps` is set to 100000. Was this tested on MUSDB18? Should this be increased?

This was not tested on musdb so a different value may be better. This could heavily depends on the other training parameters, so training/validation metrics should be monitored during training. 

> No early stopping is configures. On such a small dataset the model will suffer from significant overfitting.

We unfortunately don't provide an implementation of an early stopping mechanism implemented so far. An easy workaround is to increase the number of saved checkpoints and to select model afterward based on validation metrics.

Plus I had checked a little bit before releasing and it would be very complicated as TensorFlow JS does not provide the range of functionality _Spleeter_ is currently using in _Python_ (`estimator` API to be more specific)

But if you are motivated feel free to explore, we would love having other language adoption from contributors.

@mmoussallam I understand that but at one point people will use this to train on their own data and might publish results based on this repo.

I already trained and evaluated on MUSDB18 and it seems that there are some issues - See #81
It would be great if you could help to update the training configs for MUSDB18.

I installed via pip, homebrew, and everyway I could follow or find but with no results.

I did the same with ffmpeg using above methods (homebrew etc) still same result.

Then I noticed another folder called spleeter INSIDE the spleeter folder that had been created by the installs.  When I shifted my file into that folder ie.  '/User/###/spleeter/spleeter' - it worked without a hitch.  no more this ffprobe or 0-6.00 errors and the rest. It just worked.  Now, maybe this is the way it was meant to work all along, but with respect to the creators/devs, the manual didn't mention this? (put the file in spleeter/spleeter) or perhaps it did.. but with the complicated installs and jumping around webpages.. i could have missed it. The odd thing, is that the audio example is still in the top folder.. so IDK -wtf is going on. lol.  The guide is not easy for newbie people who've never used command lines, things like pip or homebrew and terminal concepts.  But I did get it working and my troubles were rewarded, but still don't know if it was luck or a solution..?. hopefully, it may help or steer others and get it working for them.

Interesting! Out of curiosity, is there a rationale for this behavior? Or is this just a side effect of how it works?

Thinking through how I would want it to behave in my use cases, I would prefer moving anything right at the threshold to the ""Accompaniment/Other"" file, and nowhere else

As a hypothetical example, if there were a very annoying organ line in an otherwise incredible KRS-One song, I would want to have it isolated away to one track, and missing from all other tracks if possible. ;)

Yes the current branch did not reflect in the conda environment, and should be installed manually, we will improve that as long as the fix is validated. Good to hear that the fix is working, hope it will work also at a larger scale.

Better that way :). Indeed we have no reason to do so, we will publish a `spleeter-gpu` package on `PyPi` with the appropriate `tensorflow-gpu` dependency soon. We prefer redirect GPU users to `Conda` since it will handle all GPU dependencies such as _CUDA_ which can not be automatically installed with `pip`.

Warning are produced by third party libraries like tensorflow or NumPy and does not reflect any potential issue here. An old windows PC though could be the reason. The model use a lot of memory and there is a high probability that you don’t have enough while running separation.

I get the ""loading audio <filename> from 0.0 to 600.0"" message and then it grinds for a few minutes consuming all CPU, and then just exits. The contents of ""$?"" are 0, indicating successful exit (or that the program doesn't set result codes). Sometimes only one of the models will produce any output for a given input file. Except for audio_example.mp3, which works as expected, I've yet to have the ""[x]stems"" model actually produce [x] output files. When there is output, I get 1 or 2 files at most, usually the vocal.

548798493,"Hi @danielkorg,
Thank you for you message! 
You're perfectly right, the default separation configuration does not produce components that add up to the mix. This is because spectrogram models are learnt up to 11kHz only and when separating, the default mask extension (above 11kHz) is set to 0, which means that all frequencies above 11kHz will actually be discarded in the separated files.

There is actually an option to change this default behaviour: the `mask_extension` option can be set to `zeros` (default) or to `average` (see the [wiki](https://github.com/deezer/spleeter/wiki/3.-Models#separation-parameters)). The latter extends the mask values to the average value of the masks under 11kHz, which results in masks summing to one in the whole frequency range and thus to separated tracks summing to the mix track.
The `average` option generates some interferences in the high frequencies (as modelling of the source is very rough in this frequency range), that is why we chose to set `zeros` as the default option. So you should use this option only if the interferences are less of an issue to you than not having the components summing to the mix.

You can very easily set this option by editing the [`configs/2stems/base_config.json`](https://github.com/deezer/spleeter/blob/master/configs/2stems/base_config.json) file (same for the [4stems](https://github.com/deezer/spleeter/blob/master/configs/4stems/base_config.json) and the [5stems](https://github.com/deezer/spleeter/blob/master/configs/5stems/base_config.json) config files) and replacing the  `""mask_extension"":""zeros""` option by `""mask_extension"":""average""`. Then, perform the separation with the config file option (ensure to be in the `spleeter` folder or to replace the path to the config file by a valid one):
```bash
spleeter separate -i <path/to/input/audio/file.wav> -o <path/to/output> -p configs/2stems/base_config.json
```
The separated sources should then sum up to the mix!

Training on musdb is definitely something we can do but I'm not sure how much value it would bring to end users.
Our intent with Spleeter is not so much to compare ourselves with the latest separation models but rather to provide a fast and ready-to-use separation tool for researchers doing other tasks (e.g. transcription..).

Thank you for you question.
* We did not use any MUSDB data for training or validation but datasets that we have in Deezer (which, may be part of the added value of Spleeter over other released models).
* The model is based on convolutional U-nets (one per instruments). I think some models in SISEC 2018 (JY from what I remember, but not sure, you could probably confirm that) were quite similar and got quite good performances without other data than MUSDB.
We also trained other kinds of model (such as LSTM based ones), but we finally kept this one because it makes possible very fast computation on GPUs (both for training and prediction) while having good separation results.
* On MUSDB18 test, we get the following SDR values with the 4 stems model using multichannel Wiener filtering (which improves a bit the scores, but we believe is perceptively worst than basic ratio masks):

|   | vocals  SDR  | bass SDR  | drums SDR  | other SDR  |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Spleeter 4 stems  | 6.86dB  | 5.51dB  | 6.71dB  | 4.55dB  |

Note, that we did not try do any optimization on these scores and did not use any MUSDB training data in the training process so these scores are an actual measure of the generalization power of the model (on western pop/rock song though).

There are some more detailed on the [extended abstract](http://archives.ismir.net/ismir2019/latebreaking/000036.pdf) of the demo we'll present in ISMIR next week.
