The issue seems to be caused by the CUDA IPC operations support for windows (see https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/notes/windows.html#cuda-ipc-operations).

> ""IPC is the way by which multiple processes or threads communicate with each other. IPC in OS obtains modularity, computational speedup, and data sharing.""

From Pytorch Doc:

>  ""They [IPC Operations] are not supported on Windows. Something like doing multiprocessing on CUDA tensors cannot succeed, there are two alternatives for this.
> 
> 1. Don’t use multiprocessing. Set the num_worker of [DataLoader](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/data.html#torch.utils.data.DataLoader) to zero.
> 
> 2. Share CPU tensors instead. Make sure your custom DataSet returns CPU tensors.""

1709479778,"@msaroufim I believe this issue has already been resolved.

I've examined the code, and the difference in the presence of batch_idx between the train function and the test function is because the train function prints training logs for each batch size. In contrast, the test function does not have any training log outputs, so batch_idx appears unnecessary there. Furthermore, the test function is currently running smoothly without any issues.

```
if batch_idx % args.log_interval == 0:  
    print('Train Epoch: {} [{}/{} ({:.0f}%)]\tLoss: {:.6f}'.format(  
        epoch, batch_idx * len(data), len(train_loader.dataset),  
        100. * batch_idx / len(train_loader), loss.item()))  
    if args.dry_run:  
        break
```
I don't think the above part is necessary for the test function, so it doesn't seem necessary to add batch_idx within the test function.

I would appreciate it if you could consider closing this issue.",believe issue already resolved code difference presence train function test function train function training batch size contrast test function training log unnecessary furthermore test function currently running smoothly without print epoch epoch data break think part necessary test function seem necessary add within test function would appreciate could consider issue,issue,positive,neutral,neutral,neutral,neutral,neutral

This problem cannot be solved, and the only choice is to manually place the model layer on different graphics cards to achieve mixed parallelism.

1478704101,"@steenblikrs I'd like to help you but I can't test it now as I don't want to downlaod 42 Gigs of Data. However this error looks very familiar and in my experience is just a multiprocessing + dataloader issue.

The way you'd fix this is just put everything into a `def main():` and then a 
```
if __name__ == ""__main__"": 
     main()
``` 

So now when multiple processes are created (forked) it won't execute all the code again and you won't run into this issue. 

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/64654838/pytorch-tutorial-freeze-support-issue

There are many threads on the internet regarding this issue , just try to look for them and you'll find them. But my guess is when you put everything into the __main__ syntax it will be fine.

```

My other questions are do I need a DistributedSampler for DataLoader if I only have one node?

Here's how  I run my code:
`$ time python -m torch.distributed.launch --nproc_per_node=4 train.py --data MYDATA  --out MYOUTPUT   --gpuids 0 1 2 3 --batchsize 16`

And here's the part of code I have changed from it being DataParallel to now being DistributedDataParallel:

```

parser.add_argument(""--local_rank"", default=0, type=int)

torch.cuda.set_device(opt.local_rank)
torch.distributed.init_process_group(backend='nccl',
                                     init_method='env://',
                                     timeout=datetime.timedelta(seconds=5400))



net = torch.nn.parallel.DistributedDataParallel(net.cuda(),
        device_ids=[opt.local_rank],
        output_device=opt.local_rank)
```

Do I also need to have distributed optimizer and distributed gradients too?

1214380382,"> Hi, I met the same difficulty and I had solved it. Check the function 'dset.ImageFolder' which is used to create 'dataset'. The function's '__init__'  uses ""default_loader"" that returns ""img.convert('RGB')"". It indicates that although your image is of single channel, you will get a image of three channels after the function ""img.convert(RGB)"". And the way to solve the problem is that you could use ""img.convert('L)"". A better way I suggests is rewrite the function ""ImageFolder"" on a new python file.

What I had missed was that inputs don't need to be on GPU, `nn.DataParallel` manages moving it to GPUs under the hood
```
x = torch.rand(4,1)  # on CPU
model = nn.DataParallel(model)  # replicated on all GPUs
y = model(x)  # gathered on GPU0
```

So when `args.gpu == None` (i.e. multi-GPU training with `nn.DataParallel`), the first if block keeps `images` on CPU. The second if block moves `targets` to GPU0 in case of  DataParallel, or to the respective `rank` if using DistributedDataParallel.

>  I'm not sure why these four lines of codes move 'images' to gpu only when I choose only one gpu(args.gpu is not None) and move 'target' to gpu even with argument device=None(args.gpu=None).


the reason is this.
When you do single GPU training, you dont use `nn.DataParallel`, you simply send `images` directly to your model. So `images` is moved onto GPU 0 in a straight-forward manner.

When you do multi-GPU training with `nn.DataParallel`, you keep `images` on CPU and then send it to `nn.DataParallel`, which will slice `images` into as many Tensors as there are GPUs (for example if `images` had 64 images and there  are 4 GPUs, `images` is sliced into four separate Tensors of `16` images each). These individual sliced Tensors are then sent to their respective GPUs. In the 4-GPU example, if we had sent `images` onto GPU 0 and then called `nn.DataParallel` there would be a wasteful move of `images` first to GPU0, and then each of the 3 slices of images will then each be moved from GPU0 to GPU1, GPU0 to GPU2 and GPU0 to GPU3 respectively.",incorrect sure four move choose one none move even argument reason single training dont use simply send directly model onto manner training keep send slice many example sliced four separate individual sliced sent respective example sent onto would wasteful move first respectively,issue,positive,positive,positive,positive,positive,positive

769478336,"> At a high level, this resulted from one trainer running a backwards pass while another was updating params with the optimizer. Still coordinating with folks internally to understand if this is expected behavior or not.

This makes sense. If the the param is modified between forward and backward passes, the autograd algorithm is no longer correct. Thanks for digging into this!

Regarding the fix, will it also work if we force a barrier before every `optimizer.step()`, which guarantees no unintentional param changes? In this way, we don't need multiple model copies. If the model is on CUDA, since all updates use the same default stream, they won't be race contention issues either. Not sure about CPU models though.

Because the entire turnaround of ""asking about submitting a PR"" to ""submitting a PR"" happened so quickly (within 48 hours), I missed it and didn't have a chance to respond.

I've been trying to figure out what to do with the PR, whether we should accept it or not. I don't have an answer yet. I am weighing the fact that we cover RNN as an example already in `word_language_model` and in the snli` examples.

This is true. But saving it on every node isn't wrong, and potentially will be faster when restoring from checkpoints. Because, if only rank 0 saves the model, when restoring, the the program will need to first load the checkpoint on rank 0 node, and then broadcast the model states to all other ranks. It's like file IO + network IO, and during this period of time, other ranks have to idle waiting.

Right, I feel the batching behavior should be application specific, e.g., the application might want to create a tensor as buffer for multiple requests or it might need to run some custom aggregate fn before processing each of the requests. How did you make it generic in your current implementation? 

> - Unfortunately we determined that this ""batched callback"" approach is not

This should be possible too, similar to [this example](https://github.com/pytorch/examples/pull/692), where the server launches nested RPCs.

Yes, each RPC launched from the client will be handled by a thread on the server side. So, they can happen concurrently.

cover it.

True, lock is not necessary in this example, but would be necessary if we add torchscript decorator.

In terms of C++ implementation, it can be done at different levels

Option 1: implement a custom [`RequestCallbackImpl`](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/master/torch/csrc/distributed/rpc/request_callback_impl.h) to handle request batching and [plug it in to RPC agent](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/9ce25cce9197b86f6340036bc6224d5b75ff242d/torch/csrc/distributed/rpc/process_group_agent.cpp#L96). The existing ComputationQueue can be added to it as well I think. This only requires minimum change and can keep that critical path for other applications intact (because not every application requires the batching feature).

Option 2: implement a custom [rpc agent](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/master/torch/csrc/distributed/rpc/rpc_agent.h). This would also give you the access to the thread management on the server side. You probably don't want to worry about the messaging layer. If so, we can split the current agent into separate comm module and callback/thread management module.

models for the 7 players, to take 1 game step).

Looking closely, there are a number of implementation details that look
weird to me:

In examples here you have quite simple environments and because of that you neural nets are simple too - so GPU isn't necessary.
Gym has to run on CPU so in order to perform learning on GPU you have to copy all the variables from the CPU memory to the GPU.  
Doing this at each episode (or even worse at each timestamp) will create huge bottleneck in the memory bandwidth.  
To give you some example if the model sits on the GPU you will have to copy each observation to the GPU memory every time you would like to use this data and it will be more expensive for small models than doing everything on the CPU.

Therefore, we did not use the gradient of freezing D when training the generator. So, for the generator, we did calculate the gradient of D, but we didn't update the weight of D (only optimizer_g.step was written), so the discriminator will not be changed when the generator is trained. You may ask, that's why, when you train the discriminator, you need to add detach. Isn't this an extra move?

`F.nll_loss` would compute the **average loss** of a batch by default when we train our model. Because we want to know how well each batch performs at this time to babysit our training process

when it's test time, we want to know the **average loss on the whole test set**. So we set `reduction='sum'` then it will compute the sum loss of a batch instead of average. Then we divide the size of test set `len(test_loader.dataset)` to get this average on the whole test set.

```python
for data, target in test_loader:

502385572,"Hello,
I am a little confused by this and will greatly appreciate help in understanding.
According to my understanding detach() prevents further computations from being tracked. (I suppose it also prevent previous computations from being taken into account in the backward pass?)

Either way, wouldn't you want to track the next computation, the operation of D over fake, for the backward pass of D?
If you wanted to prevent tracking of the Generator, wouldn't it make sense to detach before applying G and then restore tracking for D right at the point where detach is now called? (With requires_grad_(True)?)
Thank you",hello little confused greatly appreciate help understanding according understanding detach tracked suppose also prevent previous taken account backward pas either way would want track next computation operation fake backward pas prevent generator would make sense detach restore right point detach true thank,issue,positive,positive,neutral,neutral,positive,positive

473273301,"> first resize to a bigger size then crop, some example directly use resize(224)

`transforms.Resize()` resizes the smallest edge to the given value. Thus, if the image is not square (`height != width`) `Resize(224)` would fail to give you an image of size `(224, 224)`.

I think the image is resized at first to make motifs roughly the same size. However, I have no clue on why or how the specific value `256` was chosen.

> inceptionv3 the input size is 299, while others is 224. so the resize parameter counld set to what?

I don't think `inception_v3` can be trained with the current implementation. If you just care about this you could change it to
```python
...
transforms.Resize(299),
transforms.CenterCrop(299),
...
```
For a general solution see #268.

I had been having trouble with this example and had put some results on #215.  I had to reduce the learning rate `lr` significantly to achieve a ""good"" solution.

I ran three cases spanning the decade from `lr` = 0.01 up to `lr` = 0.10.

The videos are 10 steps / epochs per second, 300 epochs / 30 seconds total. If anyone would rather have the videos in a .zip format let me know.

As you can see, only the `lr` = 0.01 case converges to a solution which repeats in the way illustrated in the example. Both others find a different stable minimum in the cost function, in the `lr` = 0.10 case with a lower final cost than the ""better"" case that repeats stably.

I think
- when training, better fits to the training data can often be models that don't repeat well
- the slower learning rate helps the `lr` = 0.1 model move stably to ""good"" repeating solution for this one example configuration of random initial weights
- results will probably vary significantly if we use a different random initialisation of the weights

So I don't know too much what to read into this. But it might be good to change the learning rate in the example to 0.01 and set the number of learning steps / epochs to 150.

> I wonder how the error goes down with lr=0.1, while it gets seemingly worse results after step 7 according to the pdfs

I think the answer is that the LSTM model isn't being trained with the primary objective of making a nice, stable repeating sine wave.  It is trained to predict a single numerical value accurately based on an input sequence of prior numerical values.  It's kind of a different problem.

Models that predict the next value well on average in your data don't necessarily have to repeat nicely when recurrent multi-value predictions are made.  I think you might hope that the best solutions would repeat nicely, but it's not guaranteed in practice because you might not have enough data.

The task in this example is actually quite tricky.

By the way, sometimes you see smaller oscillations being preferred to larger ones in the recurrent predictions.  I think that when you see that change between epochs you are actually seeing the impact of a change in the weights to the model forget gates.  These control whether or not to retain values from a fair way back in the input sequence.  Pretty cool.",wonder error go seemingly worse step according think answer model trained primary objective making nice stable sine wave trained predict single numerical value accurately based input sequence prior numerical kind different problem predict next value well average data necessarily repeat nicely recurrent made think might hope best would repeat nicely practice might enough data task example actually quite tricky way sometimes see smaller preferred recurrent think see change actually seeing impact change model forget control whether retain fair way back input sequence pretty cool,issue,positive,positive,positive,positive,positive,positive

It strikes me that this is actually a fairly finely balanced thing to ask the NN to achieve: it is trained to predict the next point only, not a probable arc of points.  A lot of decisions can be made to support the first aim that do not necessarily support the second.  Thus solutions which achieve attractive long future predictions such as that illustrated in the documentation to this example do not necessarily persist under further training.

Is it asking too much, or am I missing something that ought to make me more optimistic?

Yes, I see that. In fact, the discriminator is trained using the gradient from two losses: 
- `loss(discriminator(real_images), label_for_real_images)` 
- `loss(discriminator(generated_images), label_for_fake_images)`.

> It is possible to do what you suggested, but summing more accurately matches the discriminator update step in the literature

I went back to check the paper and I see what you mean, the code reflects what the authors do:
```1 / #batch * (loss_on_#batch_real_images + loss_on_#batch_fakes)``` 
I'm actually surprised because I'd have intuitively done this:
```1 / (2 * #batch) * (loss_on_#batch_real_images + loss_on_#batch_fakes)```
Do you happen to have an explanation for their choice or some resource to point me to?<br/>
Anyway, the result is basically the same, the only difference is that the computed gradient is doubled, but with an adaptive learning rate this does not affect training.

> Extracting `.data` and creating a new Variable breaks the computation graph, so you wouldn't be able to backpropagate through the networks

Yes, I understand how the graph works. However, at [line 239](https://github.com/pytorch/examples/blob/aa7adf08482be9136dac7ea65a188df89a8b1c7a/dcgan/main.py#L239) the two losses have already been computed and the two gradients deriving from their backprop have already been accumulated in the weights. At that point, we don't need the sum of the losses to be part of the graph, in fact we never call `errD.backward()`, and we are only interested in its value.

It is possible to do what you suggested, but summing more accurately matches the discriminator update step in the literature (see Algorithm 1 in [the original paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1406.2661.pdf)). The discriminator is trained to recognise real data as real *and* fake data as fake. 

> Why do we operate on the Variables

Extracting `.data` and creating a new Variable breaks the computation graph, so you wouldn't be able to backpropagate through the networks. The general advice is [not to over-optimise for memory](http://pytorch.org/docs/master/notes/autograd.html#in-place-operations-on-variables).

- **Why do we sum the losses instead of taking the mean?** 
  If we were to feed to the discriminator a batch with 50 real images and 50 fakes, with the corresponding labels, we'd get a loss that is the mean of the individual losses. 
  In our case, we are feeding the network the two batches separately, computing the losses separately, backpropagating separately (but without zeroing the gradients, so that they accumulate), and then running an optimization step, but then we are summing the two losses instead of averaging
- **Why do we operate on the Variables**

I suppose the default has been tested so should work. Currently I only have access to my laptop (mac), which might be a fringe case.

Replacing LSTMCell with nn.LSTM and unrolling manually is indeed slower. This is due to overhead for weight copying. cuDNN is currently only faster when this overhead is amortized over many time steps.

Just to check, I tried replacing the cuDNN encoder with LSTMCell/StackedLSTM that the Decoder uses, and that was also slower, so it looks like the cuDNN encoder/LSTMCell Decoder combination is the sweet spot for the time being.

Running with the cuDNN decoder also caused OOM errors with the same settings that the non-cuDNN decoder could handle. @csarofeen investigated further and has reproduced a simple case here https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/issues/914.",talking thought summarize seeing unrolling manually indeed due overhead weight currently faster overhead many time check tried also like combination sweet spot time running also could handle simple case,issue,positive,positive,positive,positive,positive,positive

282784262,"@magsol I would suggest to first try your dataset on the standard 64x64. Next you run it on 128x128, with either the extra convolution or pooling layer as listed above. After that you can try 512x512, I am no expert but I have not seen pictures that large generated by a DCGAN. You could also consider generating 128x128 images and then use a separate super-resolution network to reach 512x512.

64x64 and 128x128 are easy to try (the model includes the preprocessing, i.e. the rescaling of the images) and should be easier to generate. Did you already get good results with your data on the 64x64 scale? Please share your experience so far. :smile: ",would suggest first try standard next run either extra convolution layer listed try expert seen large could also consider generating use separate network reach easy try model easier generate already get good data scale please share experience far smile,issue,positive,positive,positive,positive,positive,positive

282763446,"As @apaszke mentions, the G and D networks are generated with the 64x64 limitations hardcoded. The implementation of the DCGAN here is very similar to the dcgan.torch implementation, and someone else asked about this limitation and got this answer: https://github.com/soumith/dcgan.torch/issues/2#issuecomment-164862299

By following the changes suggested in that comment, you can expand the network for 128x128. So for the generator:
```python
class _netG(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, ngpu):
        super(_netG, self).__init__()
        self.ngpu = ngpu
        self.main = nn.Sequential(
            # input is Z, going into a convolution
            nn.ConvTranspose2d(     nz, ngf * 16, 4, 1, 0, bias=False),
            nn.BatchNorm2d(ngf * 16),
            nn.ReLU(True),
            # state size. (ngf*16) x 4 x 4
            nn.ConvTranspose2d(ngf * 16, ngf * 8, 4, 2, 1, bias=False),
            nn.BatchNorm2d(ngf * 8),
            nn.ReLU(True),
            # state size. (ngf*8) x 8 x 8
            nn.ConvTranspose2d(ngf * 8, ngf * 4, 4, 2, 1, bias=False),
            nn.BatchNorm2d(ngf * 4),
            nn.ReLU(True),
            # state size. (ngf*4) x 16 x 16 
            nn.ConvTranspose2d(ngf * 4, ngf * 2, 4, 2, 1, bias=False),
            nn.BatchNorm2d(ngf * 2),
            nn.ReLU(True),
            # state size. (ngf*2) x 32 x 32
            nn.ConvTranspose2d(ngf * 2,     ngf, 4, 2, 1, bias=False),
            nn.BatchNorm2d(ngf),
            nn.ReLU(True),
            # state size. (ngf) x 64 x 64
            nn.ConvTranspose2d(    ngf,      nc, 4, 2, 1, bias=False),
            nn.Tanh()
            # state size. (nc) x 128 x 128
        )
```
And for the discriminator:
```python
class _netD(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, ngpu):
        super(_netD, self).__init__()
        self.ngpu = ngpu
        self.main = nn.Sequential(
            # input is (nc) x 128 x 128
            nn.Conv2d(nc, ndf, 4, stride=2, padding=1, bias=False), 
            nn.LeakyReLU(0.2, inplace=True),
            # state size. (ndf) x 64 x 64
            nn.Conv2d(ndf, ndf * 2, 4, stride=2, padding=1, bias=False),
            nn.BatchNorm2d(ndf * 2),

However, as you can also see in that thread, it is harder to get a stable game between the generator and discriminator for this larger problem. To avoid this, I think you'll have to take a look at the improvements used here https://github.com/openai/improved-gan (paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.03498).

282185974,"Also, replacing LSTMCell with a single-step single-layer LSTM (that would get routed to cudnn) might help, especially for small hidden sizes. On the attached profile the small kernels after 2 gemms are pointwise operations that would get fused by cudnn (and reduce load on the CPU). That would help single GPU performance as well. Some massaging of inputs and outputs will be required (LSTMCell expects 2D input, LSTM 3D etc).

- RNNs are pretty parameter-heavy, so for small batch size maybe you spend all your time communicating parameters
- you're bottlenecked by Python executing the kernels on multiple GPUs since they're so small. I think DataParallel uses multiple threads, but the python parts hold on to the GIL.

276387534,"@fmassa The code is slightly different since with Pytorch you can easily share the weights of the net (or at least is what I assumed) whereas in the Lua version you had to deal with `ConcatTable` in order to define such architectures.

As you said some of the parts are optimized inside the loss function like the two `PairDistance` functions. In this case basically I took the TripletLoss from Chainer and I adapted to Pytorch routines. Ideally should be the same as the one that I implemented with TensorFlow¹ which btw using it I achieve almost the same results reported to the paper.

What you mention about the min is an extra contribution that we introduced in the paper² in order to improve the loss function.

276367950,"@edgarriba Hi !

@fmassa hi! :smile: Yeah I noticed about this dampening parameter, in Lua seems that takes momentum value by default. Also in case of defining a learning rate decay, by default this policy it's automatically applied. In Pytorch it's not. As for RMSProp I haven't  tried since I want to replicate original codes where we just use SGD with momentum. Actually, it's a very simple code that should work very easily!

I've tried this tricks but no luck. It looks to me that hyperparameters have to be completely different.

Some thoughts:

- I think copying from Ross's Faster-RCNN repo makes sense where appropriate. Keeping them in separate files, unchanged if possible, would be best
- There's a trade-off between making everything part of the model (nn.Container) and keeping it as part of the training function. For example, FasterRCNN.forward is a bit complicated because it combines training and evaluation logic: it has two possible return types and two possible input types.
- The `forward()` method in modules should take in `Variables` where appropriate; the wrapping of tensors in Variables should happen outside the module
- Try to match PyTorch style (PEP 8) for stuff that's not from RBG's repo. (4 space indent, etc.)
- Use Python argparse to configure options. I like how you're not passing a global cfg around. If you want to support a config file as well, I think you can do so with [ConfigParser](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3609852/which-is-the-best-way-to-allow-configuration-options-be-overridden-at-the-comman)",good think important thing get training evaluation working worry design cleaning code think ross sense appropriate keeping separate unchanged possible would best making everything part model keeping part training function example bit complicated training evaluation logic two possible return two possible input forward method take appropriate wrapping happen outside module try match style pep stuff space indent use python configure like passing global around want support file well think,issue,positive,positive,positive,positive,positive,positive
262830168,"@ludc About the stochastic modules, it's actually not as simple. It could work, however you'd need to perform the work of `:reinforce` in `backward` and treat `grad_output` as `err`. New `nn` isn't a standalone module, but rather relies heavily on machinery of `torch.autograd`, and that is designed for graphs of differentiable ops (they need to define `forward` and `backward`). You never call these `backward` methods yourself, you only do it once, on a variable, and it bootstraps the whole gradient computation and passes the control to the `ExecutionEngine`.

Some comments to the API you proposed:
* I bound the `Sense` to the `Environment` on purpose, because it has to be 100% compatible with it. There are many backends that provide you with the screen pixels, but every single one will require performing different attribute lookup, so it's logical for me that they need to be logically bound together. Maybe I'm wrong, I hardly have any experience in RL.
* Since to use the `Sense` you need to know exactly what kind of objects it returns, I decided not to force a single point that returns the full value space. For screen you can implement `.size()` and for audio you can implement `.length()`. 
* I think I didn't understand what `Feedback` is because of the name. It sounds as if it's a one time reward, while it actually defines a way to measure how well is the agent performing. It sounds more like a `Task` to me.
* I'm not sure if I like the requirement to pass `env` everywhere. I don't know how often you need to use the same `Task`/`Feedback` in different environments, but if it's not the case, then I think it would be cleaner to pass it once to `__init__`.
* I don't think I understand the difference between `feedback` and `feedback_action`.
* Isn't it better to associate the set of actions with the `World`? It seems more logical to me that it's the world that defines what you can/can't do, and the task can in turn tell you if you're done.

If you're feeling like reimplementing rltorch or sth similar so soon, then go on. I will have to work on some other stuff as well, so I can wait and review the changes if you wish.

Thanks for making the connection @soumith. 

The way we did this in https://github.com/twitter/torch-twrl is a little bit different. 

Here we have an agent defined by a learning update, a model and a policy. The agent is completey separate from the environment, and from the monitoring code. This separation allows for building in modular chunks. You can see a nice visualization here: https://blog.twitter.com/2016/reinforcement-learning-for-torch-introducing-torch-twrl 

I have been working on DDPG in pytorch, and will try to model it after the breakdown on the twrl package. Twrl was modelled after the RLLab and torch-rl. 

We should aim to enable capabilities expected by OpenAI Gym as it is the common test bed these days. I have been working on a simple continuous action space example with DDPG.

262818485,"Concerning the dpnn approach, the idea is the following:

You make a model that includes stochastic layers (for example, the MultinomialLayer takes a discrete set of pobabilities as an input and output a one hot vector by sampling following this distribution). Then the gradient can be estimated by providing a ''reward-like'' feedback to this layer before the backward. 

So, imagine you have a loss function, an input x and an output y to predict, you can do:
```

m1=Linear(....)
m2=SoftMax(...)
m3=MultinomialLayer(...)
m4=Linear(...)

a=m1:forward(x)
b=m2:forward(a)
c=m3:forward(b) #Here the sampling is made
d=m4:forward(c)

err=loss:forward(d,y)
m3:reinforce(-err) #Here, the reward is provided to the stochastic modules. It will allow to compute the derivative of the term log P(sample|input) * reward that will be backpropagated
delta=loss:backward(d,y)
delta=m4:backward(....)
delta=m3:backward(....)
delta=m2:backward(....)
delta=m1:backward(....)

```

When using with reinforcement, you directly have a reward (no loss), so you start your backpropagation with a empty delta, but the idea remains the same.  (see https://github.com/Element-Research/dpnn#nn.Reinforce)

Basically, the goal is to include stochastic modules into the computation graph, and this can be done by adding a reinforce method for these modules (but other ways can be imagined I suppose)

262816152,"OK, some differences between what you propose and rltorch:

* the Feedback class in rltorch defines the task to solve:
** It can be a reward function (but different tasks can be defined on the same environment)
** It can be an output to predict (what I call predictive reinforcement learning) e.g a category, a value, a structure if you are doing structured output prediction with reinforcement learning
** It can also contain teacher feedback (actions to take)

I think it is interesting to have a separate class for defining the task to solve,. Here is the code I imagine:

```
  `class Feedback(object): 
    def __init__(self, env):
        self.env = env

    def feedback(self,env):
        raise NonImplementedError`

    def finished(self,env):
        raise NonImplementedError`
```

Concerning the finished method, I think that one clever thing would be to define a method that list all authorized actions (or authorized domains for continuous RL). If this method returns and empty set, then the episode is finished. Other types of feedback can be defined (see https://github.com/ludc/rltorch/tree/master/torch/environments/classiclearning/classification)

The second point concerns the definition of the agent (or policy). Since the agent can receive different types of feedback (at different time steps in the process), here is what I imagine:


``` 
 def new_episode(self,information):
 #informations contains additionnal information for the intialization of the agent

def observe(self,observation):

def feedback(self,feedback):
#can be called whenever during the life of the agent, and multiple times

def sample(self):
#Sample an action

def end_episode(self,feedback):

def reset(self):
```

This definition is very general, and then can be instantiated for particular 'gradient-based' agent (what you propose in your previous post)

Concerning the RLTrainer, I have no preference....

* In Environment: a reset method (to sample an initial state) would be nice
* In Sense: being able to get information about the nature of the data provided by the sensor (the size of the tensor for example)

I can write all these classes in 'real' python during the week end, but it will be almost the same thing that the core classes of rltorch.

 How do you want to proceed ?

262807696,"Hey,

So I've been also playing with some RL lately and I started decomposing the code into different chunks and thinking how would they fit into pytorch. I think right now I ended up with something quite closely following the design of rltorch. However, if this framework works well in all/most RL cases, we could go a step further and also add define an `RLTrainer` class.

Right now, we have only a basic `torch.utils.trainer.Trainer` class, but it's definitely too general for this. I like the decomposition of the problem into World, Sensor and Policy. I only don't understand what Feedback is for (is it a generalization of a reward? do you every give non-scalar rewards?). I'd propose that we start posting code samples. My initial design is the following:

```python
class Sense(object):
    def __init__(self, env):
        self.env = env

    def observe(self):
        raise NonImplementedError


class Environment(object):
    def __init__(self):
        self.actions = set()

    def take_action(self, action):
        # update environment state
        return feedback

    # Optionally a number of senses you can use to observe the world


class Agent(object):

    def __init__(self, env):
        # initialize internal models
        # gather senses from env
        pass

    def forward(self):
        # use envs to observe the environment state
        # create input for the internal models
        # predict action / choose random one
        pass

    def backward(self, feedback):
        # generate gradients for internal models
        # can use experience replay instead of feedback
        pass

    def new_session(self):
        # clear any saved state e.g. screen history
        pass

# I'm omitting all the plugin-calling code for clarity
class RLTrainer(Trainer):

    def __init__(self, optimizer, env, agent, session_length=1000):
        self.optimizer = optimizer
        self.env = env
        self.agent = agent

    def train(self):
        self.agent.new_session()
        for i in range(session_length):
            action = self.agent.forward()
            feedback = self.env.take_action(action)
            optimizer.zero_grad()
            agent.backward(feedback)
            optimizer.step()
```

An example implementation:

```python
class GameEnvironment(Environment):
    def __init__(self):
        self.actions = set(MOVE_FORWARD, MOVE_BACKWARD, SHOOT)
        self.game = ... # initialize the game engine

    def take_action(self, action):
        self.game.update(action)

    def screen_buffer(self):
        return _ScreenBuffer(self)

    class _ScreenBuffer(Sense):
        def __init__(self, env):
            self.env = env

        def observe(self):
            return torch.FloatTensor(self.env.game.screen_buffer)

        def size(self):
            return torch.Size([1, 3, 100, 100])

class DQNAgent(Agent):
    def __init__(self, env):
        self.actions = env.actions
        self.screen_buffer = env.screen_buffer()
        self.dqn = DQN(self.screen_buffer.size(), len(self.actions))
        self.last_screens = ...
        self.replay_memory = ...

    def forward(self):
        self.remember_frame(self.screen_buffer.observe()) # updates self.last_frames

        if self._should_pick_random():
            action_idx = random() * self.num_actions
        else:
            action_idx = self._predict()
            
        self.last_action = self.actions[action_idx]
        return self.last_action

    def _should_pick_random():
        return random() > threshold

    def _predict(self):
        output = self.dqn.forward(self.last_frames)
        return output.max(1)[1]

    def backward(self, feedback):
        self.replay_memory.store(
                self.last_frames,
                self.last_action,
                feedback,
                self.screen_buffer.observe()
        )
        # sample from replay_memory and do backward on the dqn

```

262788846,"Hello, 

I just discovered pytorch yesterday, so I still have to go indepth, but my first intention was to evaluate if I can recode the rltorch package with pytorch. Basically, rltorch is very simple but more general than openAI Gym since it allows one to decompose any problem in environment, sensor, feedback and policy and thus can be also used for other problems (like supervised classification with RL, etc...). Then, making a openAI Gym wrapper is very easy. In that case, one way to test the platform is to reimplement one of the environments (e.g cartpole) and to compare the implemented environment with the openAI Gym one. I think that this could be done in a few days.

The second point concerns the implementation of policy gradient algorithms. I think that the 'dpnn' mechanism is very nice. I suppose it can be implemented in pytorch by extending the 'Container' and/or 'Module' classes to incorporate a 'reinforce' method (but I have to check to be sure)

In term of algorithms, I would like to start with: policy gradient, recurrent policy gradient, predictive policy (see rltorch), ucbpolicy (for online learning), and imitation policy (supervised)

 What do you think ?

P.S. Should I also include the version that builds an RNN from scratch? It might be instructive for people who want to do something different than what's supported by the monolith.
