Configuration Differences: The mypy configuration used when run on its own might be different from the configuration used by pre-commit. Check if there are any configuration files (e.g., mypy.ini, .mypy.ini, setup.cfg) that pre-commit is using to configure mypy. Ensure that the configuration options and settings are consistent between both invocations.

Environment Variables: mypy can be influenced by environment variables such as MYPYPATH, PYTHONPATH, etc. Make sure that the environment variables are set consistently when running mypy directly and when running it through pre-commit.

File Paths and Context: The way mypy is invoked by pre-commit might affect how it resolves file paths, dependencies, and other contextual information. Ensure that the paths and context are identical or compatible between both invocations.

Version Differences: Make sure that the version of mypy used by pre-commit matches the version you're running on its own. Differences in behavior between mypy versions could also explain the discrepancies.

Plugin Dependencies: If you're using any plugins or additional type stubs with mypy, make sure that they're installed and configured correctly for both invocations.

Command Line Flags: Double-check that the command line flags and options passed to mypy are the same in both cases. Even small differences in flags can lead to different behavior.",could contribute observing configuration configuration used run might different configuration used check configuration configure ensure configuration consistent environment environment make sure environment set consistently running directly running file context way might affect file contextual information ensure context identical compatible version make sure version used version running behavior could also explain additional type make sure correctly command line command line even small lead different behavior,issue,positive,positive,positive,positive,positive,positive

1826800478,"@tianyizheng02 mypy is a static checking tool used to identify type errors in Python code before it is run. Sometimes, mypy may report errors even though the code is correct. This could be due to the way mypy works.

First, mypy checks type annotations in Python code at runtime and tries to infer the types of variables. It may report errors when it encounters situations where it cannot infer the type of a variable, such as when a variable is not assigned a value.

Second, error reports from mypy may differ due to version and configuration differences. Sometimes, errors may be due to mypy's configuration or compatibility issues with other tools.

If mypy's error reports prevent your code from running, you can try the following solutions:

Update mypy version: Some errors may be due to using an outdated version of mypy. Upgrading to the latest version may resolve the issues.
Check type annotations: Correct usage of type annotations in your code is crucial as mypy works by checking type annotations. If you use complex or custom types in your code, ensure the definitions of these types are correct.
Add more type annotations: Sometimes, mypy errors can be resolved by adding more type annotations. Mypy may generate errors when running alone because it is a static type checking tool that checks type annotations in Python code and reports type errors. If there are type errors in the code, mypy will generate error messages.",static tool used identify type python code run sometimes may report even though code correct could due way work first type python code infer may report infer type variable variable assigned value second error may differ due version configuration sometimes may due configuration compatibility error prevent code running try following update version may due outdated version latest version may resolve check type correct usage type code crucial work type use complex custom code ensure correct add type sometimes resolved type may generate running alone static type tool type python code type type code generate error,issue,negative,positive,neutral,neutral,positive,positive

> This post seems to be this user's only contribution to GitHub -- https://github.com/excellentpu

@CaedenPH Based on your needs, I understand that you want to understand how to connect or merge all algorithms using different implementation methods. Here are some possible methods:

Use module import:
In Python, different algorithms can be imported in the form of modules. Create a main file (such as main.py), and then import functions or classes from maths/primelib.py. In this way, all algorithms can be called and managed in a central location.

__main.py__
```python
from maths.primelib import function1, function2, ...

result1 = function1()
result2 = function2()
```
Create a collection of algorithm classes:
You can create a main class that instantiates and manages all other classes containing algorithms. In this way, all algorithms can be accessed through this main class.

__main_class.py__
```python
from maths.primelib import AlgorithmClass1, AlgorithmClass2, ...

class MainAlgorithmClass:
    def init(self):
        self.algo1 = AlgorithmClass1()
        self.algo2 = AlgorithmClass2()

    def execute_algo1(self):
        return self.algo1.function()

    def execute_algo2(self):
        return self.algo2.function()
```
Using the plugin architecture:
For more complex situations, you can consider using a plugin architecture. This typically involves defining a set of interfaces, and then each algorithm implements these interfaces. The main program dynamically loads these plugins (algorithms) at runtime. This approach is more flexible, but it is also more complex to implement.",edit post user contribution based need understand want understand connect merge different implementation possible use module import python different form create main file import class way central location python import function function result function result function create collection algorithm class create main class class way main class python import class self self return self return architecture complex consider architecture typically set algorithm main program dynamically approach flexible also complex implement,issue,positive,negative,neutral,neutral,negative,negative
1826793508,"@tianyizheng02 When deciding whether to delete maths/primelib.py and distribute the implementation of related algorithms to other files, several factors need to be weighed:

Modularity and readability: Placing the implementation of each algorithm in a separate file can improve code readability and modularity. Each function or class is in a separate file, which makes it easier for readers to find the definition of a specific function or class.
Code duplication: If there are similar algorithm implementations in multiple files, this may be a form of code duplication, which may violate the principle of ""don't repeat yourself"" (DRY). If these algorithms need to be modified later, making the same changes in multiple files may lead to errors.
File quantity and maintenance: If there are many such algorithms, a large number of files may be created. A large number of files may complicate the project structure and may increase the complexity of maintenance.
Performance and execution speed: If these algorithms are performance-critical, placing them in a single file may help improve execution speed.
If these algorithms are not particularly complex and can be easily found when needed, it may be appropriate to place them in a single file. However, if these algorithms are complex or if they need to be modified frequently, it may be better to place them in separate files. This can make the code easier to understand and maintain.

In general, there is no absolute answer to this question. Depending on the specific needs and context of the project, you may need to weigh these factors and make the best decision.",whether delete distribute implementation related several need weighed readability implementation algorithm separate file improve code readability function class separate file easier find definition specific function class code duplication similar algorithm multiple may form code duplication may violate principle repeat dry need later making multiple may lead file quantity maintenance many large number may large number may complicate project structure may increase complexity maintenance performance execution speed single file may help improve execution speed particularly complex easily found may appropriate place single file however complex need frequently may better place separate make code easier understand maintain general absolute answer question depending specific need context project may need weigh make best decision,issue,positive,positive,positive,positive,positive,positive

2. Do you think it would be a good idea to move all of the primitives (Angle, Side) to a file (f.e. 'primities.py'), and Shapes into a different file (f.e. 'shapes.py'), as a more structured approach (leave files such as open_shape, closed_shape, e.t.c.)?

3. Based on 'The Algorithms' structure, and the mission of the repo, would it be better to leave the structure as it is right now, complicated yet easy to add onto in the future (f.e. adding a new class to the structure), if anyone wishes, or to simplify it by modifying the existing code directly (f.e. adding a new method to an existing class), yet making it harder to add onto in the future?",new file bunch feedback structure create current pull request difficult review great stuff need four side two building easier thank incredibly thorough code review check whether understood everything correctly mind waste time future keep code one file code review code one file simply efficient code review original structure fine think would good idea move angle side file different file structured approach leave based structure mission would better leave structure right complicated yet easy add onto future new class structure anyone simplify code directly new method class yet making harder add onto future,issue,positive,positive,positive,positive,positive,positive

Thank you for your suggestion! Your input is much appreciated!
I noticed that the prime filtering for 072 is already implemented in sol2.py. Although it is as fast as sol1 with both taking 1 sec. What should be done in this case?
Also, I've identified a bug in 'sol1.py' that appears to be related to integer overflow. This issue specifically arises on Windows platforms because, by default, numpy on `Windows 64-bit` uses 32-bit integers, whereas on Linux, it employs 64-bit integers, so it also went unnoticed in automated checking of this repo. See #10672.

> An Algorithm is one or more functions (or classes) that:
> - take one or more inputs,
> - perform some internal calculations or data manipulations,
> - return one or more outputs,

> Algorithms should be packaged in a way that would make it easy for readers to put them into larger programs.

In short, an algorithm is a function that performs calculations on a given input to produce an output in order to accomplish some general task. Think of the type of algorithms you learn in a computer science class: Dijkstra's algorithm, quick sort, depth-first search, extended Euclidean algorithm, etc. Going by this definition, your program is at the very least a **script** and not an algorithm by this definition. Furthermore, you yourself described your program as a ""game"" multiple times.

1751821306,"The ""Wildcard Matching"" problem offers several advantages. Firstly, it promotes the development of algorithmic skills, enhancing one's ability to handle string manipulation and efficiently manage patterns containing wildcard characters. Secondly, it aids in comprehending and effectively handling commonly used wildcard patterns like '*' and '?,' which find utility in various applications, including regular expressions. Additionally, as a challenging problem categorized as hard, it serves as an intellectual exercise, fostering logical thinking and creativity. Furthermore, its practical relevance in text processing, information retrieval, and file searching underscores its significance in real-world scenarios, making it a valuable problem-solving endeavor.",matching problem several firstly development algorithmic one ability handle string manipulation efficiently manage secondly effectively handling commonly used like find utility various regular additionally problem hard intellectual exercise fostering logical thinking creativity furthermore practical relevance text information retrieval file searching significance making valuable endeavor,issue,positive,positive,neutral,neutral,positive,positive

1751797424,"@Pranjal-231003 The issue here is that some algorithms have multiple implementations, and these implementations are often scattered across multiple files. Sometimes these files will have very different names or will be scattered across multiple directories. This is a problem because it makes it harder for users to compare implementations and harder for contributors to figure out whether an algorithm is in the repo or not. We want to put different implementations of the same algorithm into a single file so that it's all in one place.

For example, this repo used to have `factorial_recursive.py` and `factorial_iterative.py`. We combined them into a single file `factorial.py`, and this file contains both the recursive implementation and the iterative implementation. This is the work that we're asking contributors to do for this issue.

If you want to contribute to solving this issue, look around the codebase and find an algorithm that's implemented by multiple files. Choose one of those files to keep, and copy the code from the other files into this main file. You may need to rename the file or rename some functions when you do this. Once you're done with that and you've confirmed that everything still works, please open a PR and one of us maintainers will get around to reviewing it eventually.",issue multiple often scattered across multiple sometimes different scattered across multiple problem harder compare harder figure whether algorithm want put different algorithm single file one place example used combined single file file recursive implementation iterative implementation work issue want contribute issue look around find algorithm multiple choose one keep copy code main file may need rename file rename done confirmed everything still work please open one u get around eventually,issue,negative,positive,neutral,neutral,positive,positive

Description:
This Python script, `hours_to_minutes_converter.py`, is a utility for converting time from hours to minutes. It includes a function `hours_to_minutes(hours)` that takes a floating-point value representing hours and returns the equivalent time in minutes.

The script is designed with error handling, ensuring that it handles both positive and negative input values appropriately. Additionally, it includes doctests to demonstrate the function's usage and behavior.

Usage:
You can use this script to quickly convert time values in hours to minutes. Simply call the `hours_to_minutes` function with your desired input.

Example Usage:
```python
>>> hours_to_minutes(2)
120

>>> hours_to_minutes(0)
0

>>> hours_to_minutes(-3)

2. In data analysis, you may encounter situations where you want to group data points into clusters based on some criteria, and this problem can be used to find the largest subset of data points that are related according to specific rules.

Sorry for the miscommunication from my side, but the issue is that if no solution exists, what would it return with 0 total paths in place of one possible solution?

    - return one or more outputs,
    - have minimal side effects (Ex. print(), plot(), read(), write()).

3. This PR is primarily a how-to because it relies entirely on the imported `Fernet` class for the encryption/decription. Again from our contributing guidelines:
    ```
    Algorithms in this repo should not be how-to examples for existing Python packages.
    Instead, they should perform internal calculations or manipulations to convert input values
    into different output values. Those calculations or manipulations can use data types,
    classes, or functions of existing Python packages but each algorithm in this repo should
    add unique value.

@cclaus If an exception is raised, the caller still has to wrap each function call in a try-except clause and catch the correct exception. In Nim, I would use an Option type (the equivalent of Result type in Rust, I guess?).
Maybe in Python, the closest to an Option type would be a dataclass with a list[list[int]] attribute and a boolean flag?
The caller would have to check for the boolean flag before accessing the maze, but at least the program would not crash in that case.
Exceptions are frequent in other Python Algorithm snippets, but they are often used for a bad user input. Here, the None type is a frequent and expected output of the algorithm.",old pull request something missing two different work caller please consider raising exception solution exception raised caller still wrap function call clause catch correct exception nim would use option type equivalent result type rust guess maybe python option type would list list attribute flag caller would check flag maze least program would crash case frequent python algorithm often used bad user input none type frequent output algorithm,issue,negative,negative,negative,negative,negative,negative

Hello,

I appreciate the feedback on my pull request. I understand that the changes I made significantly shortened the code, and I want to provide some context for my actions as a beginner.

I also noticed that my PR was marked as spam, and I'd like to let you know that my intention was not to spam the project but to contribute. As a beginner, I may have yet to grasp the project's standards at the time fully, so I apologize.

1742430580,"# Proposed Changes to Heap's Algorithm

## Advantages

### Simplification
The revised version introduces a more self-contained approach by passing the result list (`res`) directly to the recursive function. This decouples the function from outer-scope variables, enhancing its modularity and readability.

### Efficiency
Relocating the `len(arr) <= 1` check outside the recursive function ensures it's executed only once. This offers a performance boost, especially for longer input lists, by reducing unnecessary checks.

## `timeit` Benchmark Results

| Test List       | Original Algorithm (s) | Proposed Algorithm (s) |
|-----------------|------------------------|------------------------|
| `[1, 2, 3, 4]`  | 0.111138824            | 0.067861666            |

For the input list `[1, 2, 3, 4]`, the proposed algorithm is notably faster than the original, showcasing its better scalability with larger inputs.

## Conclusion

The proposed changes, while introducing enhanced code clarity, also offer improved performance for more extensive input lists, making a compelling case for this revision.

1742042658,"Cycle sort and cyclic sort are related sorting algorithms, but they are not
exactly the same thing.

Cyclic Sort:
Cyclic sort is a comparison-based sorting algorithm that works on the
principle of cycling through the elements to arrange them in the correct
order. The basic idea behind cyclic sort is to iterate through the array,
place each element in its correct position by swapping it with the element
currently at that position. Cyclic sort assumes that the elements to be
sorted are integers in a specific range. It has a time complexity of O(n)
but requires O(1) additional space.

Cycle Sort:
Cycle sort is also a comparison-based in-place sorting algorithm. It is
based on the idea of finding cycles in the permutation being sorted. It
achieves this by rotating elements within the cycle to their correct
position. Cycle sort can be used for sorting data in memory with very
limited auxiliary space requirements, making it useful for
memory-constrained environments. It also has a time complexity of O(n^2) in
the worst case.

In summary, cyclic sort is a specific sorting technique where elements are
placed in their correct position by cycling through the array, while cycle
sort is a broader sorting algorithm that involves identifying and rotating
cycles in the permutation being sorted. The terms are related, but they
refer to different concepts in sorting algorithms.

The '>>>>>>>' and '======' stuff comes from the git merge. When there is a conflict (a file being changed in the two original branches), `git` modify the file and let the two code versions in the same file separated by `<<<<<<<`, `==========` and `>>>>>>`.

This solution is significantly faster than the previous one. I ran a benchmark on my machine:

 - The previous solution takes around 24s to compute (which motivates it's presence at the top of #8594).
 - This solution takes around 3µs.

The time complexity of the previous solution seems at least exponential in the considered number of digits. This solution has a linear time complexity that can easily be improved into a logarithmic / constant complexity.

1678911397,"@nazanintalebi  So, here is what I could infer from the issue.

If you'd look closely in the Data table that you provided , you can see that you have a _whitespace characters_ at few places in your table.

> Date/ **Active ingredient**/ **Drug name** /Company
> 7/25/2023/ Lotilaner/ lotilaner/ **Tarsus Pharmaceuticals**
> 7/21/2023/ Cantharidin/ Ycanth/ **Verrica Pharmaceuticals**
> 7/20/2023/ **Quizartinib dihydrochloride**/ Vanflyta/ **Daiichi Sankyo**
> 7/17/2023/ Nirsevimab/ Beyfortus /AstraZeneca
> 6/27/2023/ Somatrogon/ Ngenla/ **Pfizer Inc**
> 6/26/2023/ Rozanolixizumab/ Rystiggo/ **UCB Inc**

and when you split this data using `.split()` , it includes all the whitespace characters there are in the the data, and hence your table wasn't accurate

**To Solve this**, you could use `.split(""/"")` which would split your data everywhere where it encounters a '/' character. However you would also have to edit your data accordingly, by changing the data format from dd/mm/yyyy to dd-mm-yyyy

> Date/ Active ingredient/ Drug name /Company
> 7-25-2023/ Lotilaner/ lotilaner/ Tarsus Pharmaceuticals
> 7-21-2023/ Cantharidin/ Ycanth/ Verrica Pharmaceuticals
> 7-20-2023/ Quizartinib dihydrochloride/ Vanflyta/ Daiichi Sankyo
> 7-17-2023/ Nirsevimab/ Beyfortus /AstraZeneca
> 6-27-2023/ Somatrogon/ Ngenla/ Pfizer Inc
> 6-26-2023/ Rozanolixizumab/ Rystiggo/ UCB Inc

Another error you would face then would be the new line characters after every company name. For that you could simply add
`drugCompany.append(dsplit[3]**.strip('\n'))**` to strip the string of any newline characters.

This  probably should solve your issue.

Attached in the archived file 'test75.py.tar.gz', file 'test75.py'. It contains the 'jacobi_test' function, which calculates according to the new algorithm. The arrays 'coefficient', 'constant', 'init_val' and the number 'n' (ascending) are generated. In the first iteration 2 x 2, the last iteration we have an array of 256 x 256( 'coefficient').
To check the performance, the [perfplot](https://github.com/nschloe/perfplot) library is used, in which, in the 'equality_check' function, both received arrays are checked for equality.

The size of the 'coefficient' array is printed on each iteration:

After n > 256 the array becomes so much larger and np.inf and -np.inf appear, which leads to nan numbers, both in the new and old calculation(this happens because the values get very small. With the upgraded numpy this doesn't happen).",change mostly good could get performance plot input size based current plot like new algorithm growing faster rate old algorithm concern algorithm become old one get sufficiently large attached file file function according new algorithm number ascending first iteration last iteration array check performance library used function received checked equality size array printed iteration array becomes much appear nan new old calculation get small happen,issue,positive,positive,positive,positive,positive,positive

2) `normalization` assumes the interval bounds to be the min and max of the list, and

1648681907,"> This division is related to the derivative of the cost function during optimization, particularly when using gradient descent. By dividing the SSE by 2 * len_data, the derivative of the cost function (SSE) with respect to the model parameters (theta) becomes simpler and results in a cleaner expression.

It's perfectly fine to scale the loss function to make the math cleaner, but again the problem here is that this scaled version is no longer the SSE. SSE has a precise mathematical definition, so why should we call the scaled version the SSE when it's clearly not? Why not just call it `scaled_sum_of_squared_errors` or `half_mean_squared_error`?

> Mean Squared Error (MSE), which is calculated as SSE divided by 2 * len_data

This is just factually wrong. MSE is defined to be SSE divided by `len_data`, _with no division by 2._ I pointed this out already in [my previous comment](https://github.com/TheAlgorithms/Python/pull/8885#discussion_r1271330609), and you can easily verify this fact with [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean_squared_error) or your search engine of choice:

$$\mathrm{MSE} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i = 1}^{n} (Y_i - \hat{Y}_i)^2$$

While I _have_ seen half of the MSE used in the context of ML (because, as you pointed out, it can make the math cleaner), we should definitely avoid misleading people with a different definition because this repo is for educational purposes.

Anyway, you missed the whole point of my issue. My whole point was that the output of the function `sum_of_square_error` is _not_ the SSE. This is still absolutely true, and I've already demonstrated it to you using both code and math. Plus, the fact that you've been referring to the implementation's loss function as the MSE shows that you also acknowledge that it's _not_ the SSE. If you prefer MSE (or half of the MSE) because it's more interpretable or more computationally elegant, then that's perfectly fine—I personally couldn't care less as to whether this implementation uses SSE or MSE. However, in order to not be incorrect or misleading, the function name should still be changed to reflect what it actually calculates.",division related derivative cost function optimization particularly gradient descent dividing derivative cost function respect model theta becomes simpler cleaner expression perfectly fine scale loss function make math cleaner problem scaled version longer precise mathematical definition call scaled version clearly call mean squared error calculated divided factually wrong defined divided division pointed already previous comment easily verify fact search engine choice seen half used context pointed make math cleaner definitely avoid misleading people different definition educational anyway whole point issue whole point output function still absolutely true already code math plus fact implementation loss function also acknowledge prefer half interpretable elegant perfectly personally could care le whether implementation however order incorrect misleading function name still reflect actually,issue,positive,positive,neutral,neutral,positive,positive
1648391610,"As far as the calculation of the SSE this is what i found :

when it comes to the calculation of the Sum of Squared Errors (SSE), the division by 2 * len_data is a significant factor. This division is related to the derivative of the cost function during optimization, particularly when using gradient descent. By dividing the SSE by 2 * len_data, the derivative of the cost function (SSE) with respect to the model parameters (theta) becomes simpler and results in a cleaner expression.

Additionally, it is worth noting that the cost function commonly used in linear regression is the Mean Squared Error (MSE), which is calculated as SSE divided by 2 * len_data:

MSE = SSE / (2 * len_data)

When taking the derivative of MSE with respect to the model parameters (theta), you get:

d(MSE)/d(theta) = (1/len_data) * (theta.dot(data_x.transpose()) - data_y.transpose()).dot(data_x)

Here, the division by 2 in the original SSE equation cancels out during the differentiation process, and the term 1/len_data helps scale the gradients appropriately to handle datasets of different sizes.

Although the division by 2 * len_data doesn't directly impact the optimization process, it offers a more interpretable representation of the derivative of the cost function, which can be advantageous in certain contexts.

Whether to include the division by 2 * len_data in the cost function is a matter of preference. Some implementations choose to omit this division and adjust the learning rate accordingly to compensate for the scale change. However, to ensure consistency throughout the optimization process and related calculations, it's essential to make a deliberate choice and adhere to it.

So i don't believe your speculation is correct and the implementation of the SSE stands that's from me.

In-memory representation: When you read a file into memory using file = f.read(), the contents of the file are stored in memory.

The in-memory representation may also include additional metadata and data structures used by Python to manage the string object.

Memory overhead: The Python interpreter itself requires memory to run. This includes the memory used by the Python runtime, the standard library, and other runtime components. This memory overhead is typically fixed and doesn't depend directly on the size of the file being processed.

Data structures and caching: Depending on the operations you perform on the file data, Python may create additional data structures or use caching mechanisms that increase memory usage. For example, if you process the file line by line or perform certain operations on the file data, Python may create additional objects or buffers in memory to facilitate those operations.

@cclauss The problem is that I believe the contributor originally based the implementation on this [Qiskit learning article](https://qiskit.org/textbook/ch-algorithms/quantum-key-distribution.html), but that link is now broken. There's this [newer link](https://learn.qiskit.org/course/ch-algorithms/quantum-key-distribution), but the implementation in this article is significantly different from the contributor's implementation in a few ways. I tried to check whether the current implementation at least matches
```py
if __name__ == ""__main__"":
    print(f""The generated key is : {bb84(16, seed=0)}"")
```
but the current implementation outright segfaults. I don't know if there's any way for us to confirm whether the original implementation was ever correct (unless one of us happens to be very familiar with Qiskit and quantum key distribution).

Edit: I found the original Qiskit article on the [Wayback Machine](https://web.archive.org/web/20221002165619/https://qiskit.org/textbook/ch-algorithms/quantum-key-distribution.html) (snapshot is from October 2022 and the implementation is from November 2022, so this is the closest version of the article).

I just added https://github.com/TheAlgorithms/Python/pull/8693/commits/4a13d5d118191f40fc443ea6a5fd121fcff3b268 which raises an error when trying to delete a non-existent element in a Binary Search Tree. As for the `generate_key` function, it only has the size argument and I don't see any interesting potential error.
2. I discovered that the secrets module [doesn't have  have `seed` method](https://stackoverflow.com/a/65432128/16926605). That would be important for doctests. Also, I thought that the main goal this project is not to use it in production code, but to teach algorithms in a way that it is even easier than reading Wikipedia or a book.",hi rohan thanks review added error trying delete element binary search tree function size argument see interesting potential error discovered module seed method would important also thought main goal project use production code teach way even easier reading book,issue,negative,positive,positive,positive,positive,positive

@cclauss No I did not, but why should someone have to **make an account from some website**, **get an api key** and **export this api key** just to run local tests? It doesn't make any sense that one algorithm causes such a hassle

In this discussion https://github.com/TheAlgorithms/Python/discussions/8791 people are confused why running the tests locally fails due to one algorithm.

This change does not break the algorithm, just moves getting the API_KEY into the `if __name__ == ""__main__""` block to allow the tests to pass.",understand get key put key environment variable running code someone make account get key export key run local make sense one algorithm hassle discussion people confused running locally due one algorithm change break algorithm getting block allow pas,issue,negative,negative,neutral,neutral,negative,negative

1573737807,"> Seems like a lot more code to solve the same problem. Is it faster?

Hi @cclauss ,
I haved added extra functions and extra code to handle edge cases. For example-
`get_number` is used to simultaneously check whether the string is a number or not. In the current version it is checked by [.isdigit()](https://github.com/TheAlgorithms/Python/blob/3a9e5fa5ecea0df54ed3ffdcb74f46171199f552/data_structures/stacks/postfix_evaluation.py#L39) but floating point numbers cannot be detected by isdigit. The current postfix evaluation can only handle integer numbers.
`is_operator` is simply a helper function such that the program does'nt crash when it gets some other characters apart from numbers and mathematical operators (+,-,*,/,^) and prompts appropriate error message.
The `evaluate()` method is basically the [solve()](https://github.com/TheAlgorithms/Python/blob/3a9e5fa5ecea0df54ed3ffdcb74f46171199f552/data_structures/stacks/postfix_evaluation.py#L23) method of the current implementation with additional if else block to handle wrong input and unary operators. I have not changed the postfix evaluation logic.
`is_yes` is just a helper function as I have made the program a little bit more interactive in the main method by promtping for more expressions and asking choice for the user. If you want I can remove this part.

I am new to open source contribution. Please guide me on what else I can do to make the code shorter or faster.
Thanks.",like lot code solve problem faster hi added extra extra code handle edge used simultaneously check whether string number current version checked floating point current postfix evaluation handle integer simply helper function program crash apart mathematical appropriate error message evaluate method basically solve method current implementation additional else block handle wrong input unary postfix evaluation logic helper function made program little bit interactive main method choice user want remove part new open source contribution please guide else make code shorter faster thanks,issue,negative,positive,neutral,neutral,positive,positive

1570632531,"Yes.  You are wrong.  This `ruff` workflow is designed to be superfast (< 10 sec) and is run with the `--format=github` setting which creates GitHub Annotations like the one below.  This provides contributors with lightning fast in-context feedback on their pull requests. Running `ruff --format=github` in pre-commit is ___much___ slower in GitHub Actions (need to build environments for all utilities) and would provide sub-optimal error messages on contributors' machines.
Given that `ruff` itself runs in under a second on all repos, I think it is a insignificant penalty to run it twice in GHA.

1556541674,"I think there are three main ways that we can implement this, but none of them is a perfect solution:

1. We could distinguish (unary) negation operators from (binary) subtraction operators, perhaps by using different symbols for each. Otherwise, the algorithm would treat all negative signs as subtraction and try to pop two operands off the stack when it should only pop one (which is what it currently does). Of course, it's inconvenient to force users to make this distinction when entering input.
2. We could sidestep negation operators entirely by always having `0 - x` instead of `-x`. Thus, we'd have `02-3+` for `0-2+3`, which would correctly evaluate to `1` using the current algorithm. Of course, this would also be inconvenient to enforce.
3. We could try to disambiguate negation from subtraction using the contents of the stack. For instance, `2-3+` raises an exception because the algorithm thinks that the `-` is subtraction and tries to pop two operands from the stack when there's only one. To fix this, we could have it so that `-` is treated as negation when there's only one operand on the stack. There may be edge cases where this doesn't work, but I'm not sure.

Let me know if you've thought of any other potential solutions.",think three main way implement none perfect solution could distinguish unary negation binary subtraction perhaps different otherwise algorithm would treat negative subtraction try pop two stack pop one currently course inconvenient force make distinction entering input could negation entirely always instead thus would correctly evaluate current algorithm course would also inconvenient enforce could try negation subtraction content stack instance exception algorithm subtraction pop two stack one fix could negation one operand stack may edge work sure let know thought potential,issue,negative,positive,neutral,neutral,positive,positive

Rather than leaving this ambiguous or introducing an exception to the exception, we simply say that `__init__` ought to have a return annotation; the default behavior is thus the same as for other methods.)

1301117228,"Let's see what @poyea and @dhruvmanila think but I really like [brief solutions](https://github.com/cclauss/Ten-lines-or-less) but I am not a fan of [code-golf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_golf) levels of illegible code.  Our overall goal is to teach, not confuse.  We want visitors to become more confident coders who can work well in teams.  Cryptic solutions are not easy for teams to maintain.  Understandable, maintainable, and performant code is what we want to make available for visitors to study and improve.

I used to be strictly against multiple implementations of an algorithm but now I lean more towards multiple implementations of popular algorithms (Fibonacci) that live in a single file so they can be studied, tested, and benchmarked side-by-side.

1295389282,"> Why should the new function force the old function to change?

BFS is an algorithm to traverse the tree in a specific order ([gif from wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breadth-first_search#/media/File:Animated_BFS.gif)). So 2 items are important here that all nodes are visited and the order in which they are visited. The problem with the existing implementation is that it returns all nodes in the collection that does not maintain order  and remove duplicates (set).  And the test was checking only that all nodes have been visited at least once.  I consider this to be a very strange return type for the BFS and I am willing to address it. 

Another problem is that implementation of the queue data structure that is used in the first function is not really efficient for such tasks. It's like hammering nails with a microscope.  I'd prefer o keep only one implementation with a more suitable data structure.

A function called get() is not self-documenting and may confuse the reader (""Get what from where?"") so lets use requests.get() instead.

The current issue, as stated in the title is that, it is better to choose the pivot at a random point then choosing the last element every time.  

So using the Random module, choose a Random point between 0 & the length of the array and use that as a pivot.

Range
Immutable and hashable sequence of integers.

<range> = range(stop)                       # range(to_exclusive)
<range> = range(start, stop)                # range(from_inclusive, to_exclusive)
<range> = range(start, stop, ±step)         # range(from_inclusive, to_exclusive, ±step_size)
>>> [i for i in range(3)]
[0, 1, 2]
Enumerate
for i, el in enumerate(<collection> [, i_start]):
    ...
Iterator
<iter> = iter(<collection>)                 # `iter(<iter>)` returns unmodified iterator.
<iter> = iter(<function>, to_exclusive)     # A sequence of return values until 'to_exclusive'.
<el>   = next(<iter> [, default])           # Raises StopIteration or returns 'default' on end.
<list> = list(<iter>)                       # Returns a list of iterator's remaining elements.
Itertools
from itertools import count, repeat, cycle, chain, islice
<iter> = count(start=0, step=1)             # Returns updated value endlessly. Accepts floats.
<iter> = repeat(<el> [, times])             # Returns element endlessly or 'times' times.
<iter> = cycle(<collection>)                # Repeats the sequence endlessly.
<iter> = chain(<coll_1>, <coll_2> [, ...])  # Empties collections in order (figuratively).
<iter> = chain.from_iterable(<coll>)        # Empties collections inside a collection in order.
<iter> = islice(<coll>, to_exclusive)       # Only returns first 'to_exclusive' elements.
<iter> = islice(<coll>, from_inclusive, …)  # `to_exclusive, +step_size`. Indices can be None.
Generator
Any function that contains a yield statement returns a generator.
Generators and iterators are interchangeable.
def count(start, step):
    while True:
        yield start
        start += step
>>> counter = count(10, 2)
>>> next(counter), next(counter), next(counter)
(10, 12, 14)
Type
Everything is an object.
Every object has a type.
Type and class are synonymous.
<type> = type(<el>)                          # Or: <el>.__class__
<bool> = isinstance(<el>, <type>)            # Or: issubclass(type(<el>), <type>)
>>> type('a'), 'a'.__class__, str
(<class 'str'>, <class 'str'>, <class 'str'>)
Some types do not have built-in names, so they must be imported:
from types import FunctionType, MethodType, LambdaType, GeneratorType, ModuleType
Abstract Base Classes
Each abstract base class specifies a set of virtual subclasses. These classes are then recognized by isinstance() and issubclass() as subclasses of the ABC, although they are really not. ABC can also manually decide whether or not a specific class is its virtual subclass, usually based on which methods the class has implemented. For instance, Iterable ABC looks for method iter(), while Collection ABC looks for iter(), contains() and len().

Regex
import re
<str>   = re.sub(<regex>, new, text, count=0)  # Substitutes all occurrences with 'new'.
<list>  = re.findall(<regex>, text)            # Returns all occurrences as strings.
<list>  = re.split(<regex>, text, maxsplit=0)  # Use brackets in regex to include the matches.
<Match> = re.search(<regex>, text)             # Searches for first occurrence of the pattern.
<Match> = re.match(<regex>, text)              # Searches only at the beginning of the text.
<iter>  = re.finditer(<regex>, text)           # Returns all occurrences as Match objects.
Argument 'new' can be a function that accepts a Match object and returns a string.
Search() and match() return None if they can't find a match.
Argument 'flags=re.IGNORECASE' can be used with all functions.
Argument 'flags=re.MULTILINE' makes '^' and '$' match the start/end of each line.
Argument 'flags=re.DOTALL' makes dot also accept the '\n'.
Use r'\1' or '\\1' for backreference ('\1' returns a character with octal code 1).
Add '?' after '*' and '+' to make them non-greedy.
Match Object
<str>   = <Match>.group()                      # Returns the whole match. Also group(0).
<str>   = <Match>.group(1)                     # Returns part in the first bracket.
<tuple> = <Match>.groups()                     # Returns all bracketed parts.
<int>   = <Match>.start()                      # Returns start index of the match.
<int>   = <Match>.end()                        # Returns exclusive end index of the match.
Special Sequences
'\d' == '[0-9]'                                # Matches decimal characters.
'\w' == '[a-zA-Z0-9_]'                         # Matches alphanumerics and underscore.
'\s' == '[ \t\n\r\f\v]'                        # Matches whitespaces.
By default, decimal characters, alphanumerics and whitespaces from all alphabets are matched unless 'flags=re.ASCII' argument is used.
As shown above, it restricts all special sequence matches to the first 128 characters and prevents '\s' from accepting '[\x1c-\x1f]' (the so-called separator characters).
Use a capital letter for negation (all non-ASCII characters will be matched when used in combination with ASCII flag).
Format
<str> = f'{<el_1>}, {<el_2>}'            # Curly brackets can also contain expressions.
<str> = '{}, {}'.format(<el_1>, <el_2>)  # Or: '{0}, {a}'.format(<el_1>, a=<el_2>)
<str> = '%s, %s' % (<el_1>, <el_2>)      # Redundant and inferior C style formatting.
Attributes
>>> Person = collections.namedtuple('Person', 'name height')
>>> person = Person('Jean-Luc', 187)
>>> f'{person.height}'
'187'
>>> '{p.height}'.format(p=person)
'187'
General Options
{<el>:<10}                               # '<el>      '
{<el>:^10}                               # '   <el>   '
{<el>:>10}                               # '      <el>'
{<el>:.<10}                              # '<el>......'
{<el>:0}                                 # '<el>'
Options can be generated dynamically: f'{<el>:{<str/int>}[…]}'.
Adding '!r' before the colon converts object to string by calling its repr() method.

When both rounding up and rounding down are possible, the one that returns result with even last digit is chosen. That makes '{6.5:.0f}' a '6' and '{7.5:.0f}' an '8'.

Combinatorics
Every function returns an iterator.
If you want to print the iterator, you need to pass it to the list() function first!
from itertools import product, combinations, combinations_with_replacement, permutations

[(0, 0, 0), (0, 0, 1), (0, 1, 0), (0, 1, 1), ..., (1, 1, 1)]

Datetime
Module 'datetime' provides 'date' <D>, 'time' <T>, 'datetime' <DT> and 'timedelta' <TD> classes. All are immutable and hashable.
Time and datetime objects can be 'aware' <a>, meaning they have defined timezone, or 'naive' <n>, meaning they don't.
If object is naive, it is presumed to be in the system's timezone.

Constructors
<D>  = date(year, month, day)               # Only accepts valid dates from 1 to 9999 AD.
<T>  = time(hour=0, minute=0, second=0)     # Also: `microsecond=0, tzinfo=None, fold=0`.
<DT> = datetime(year, month, day, hour=0)   # Also: `minute=0, second=0, microsecond=0, …`.
<TD> = timedelta(weeks=0, days=0, hours=0)  # Also: `minutes=0, seconds=0, microsecond=0`.
Use '<D/DT>.weekday()' to get the day of the week as an int, with Monday being 0.
'fold=1' means the second pass in case of time jumping back for one hour.
Timedelta normalizes arguments to ±days, seconds (< 86 400) and microseconds (< 1M).
Now
<D/DTn>  = D/DT.today()                     # Current local date or naive datetime.
<DTn>    = DT.utcnow()                      # Naive datetime from current UTC time.
<DTa>    = DT.now(<tzinfo>)                 # Aware datetime from current tz time.
To extract time use '<DTn>.time()', '<DTa>.time()' or '<DTa>.timetz()'.
Timezone
<tzinfo> = UTC                              # UTC timezone. London without DST.
<tzinfo> = tzlocal()                        # Local timezone. Also gettz().
<tzinfo> = gettz('<Continent>/<City>')      # 'Continent/City_Name' timezone or None.
<DTa>    = <DT>.astimezone(<tzinfo>)        # Datetime, converted to the passed timezone.
<Ta/DTa> = <T/DT>.replace(tzinfo=<tzinfo>)  # Unconverted object with a new timezone.
Encode
<D/T/DT> = D/T/DT.fromisoformat('<iso>')    # Object from ISO string. Raises ValueError.
<DT>     = DT.strptime(<str>, '<format>')   # Datetime from str, according to format.
<D/DTn>  = D/DT.fromordinal(<int>)          # D/DTn from days since the Gregorian NYE 1.
<DTn>    = DT.fromtimestamp(<real>)         # Local time DTn from seconds since the Epoch.
<DTa>    = DT.fromtimestamp(<real>, <tz.>)  # Aware datetime from seconds since the Epoch.
ISO strings come in following forms: 'YYYY-MM-DD', 'HH:MM:SS.mmmuuu[±HH:MM]', or both separated by an arbitrary character. All parts following hours are optional.
Python uses the Unix Epoch: '1970-01-01 00:00 UTC', '1970-01-01 01:00 CET', ...
Decode
<str>    = <D/T/DT>.isoformat(sep='T')      # Also: `timespec='auto/hours/minutes/seconds/…'`.
<str>    = <D/T/DT>.strftime('<format>')    # Custom string representation.
<int>    = <D/DT>.toordinal()               # Days since Gregorian NYE 1, ignoring time and tz.
<float>  = <DTn>.timestamp()                # Seconds since the Epoch, from DTn in local tz.
<float>  = <DTa>.timestamp()                # Seconds since the Epoch, from aware datetime.
Format
>>> dt = datetime.strptime('2015-05-14 23:39:00.00 +2000', '%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S.%f %z')
>>> dt.strftime(""%A, %dth of %B '%y, %I:%M%p %Z"")
""Thursday, 14th of May '15, 11:39PM UTC+02:00""
'%Z' only accepts 'UTC/GMT' and local timezone's code. '%z' also accepts '±HH:MM'.
For abbreviated weekday and month use '%a' and '%b'.
Arithmetics
<D/DT>   = <D/DT>  ± <TD>                   # Returned datetime can fall into missing hour.
<TD>     = <D/DTn> - <D/DTn>                # Returns the difference, ignoring time jumps.
<TD>     = <DTa>   - <DTa>                  # Ignores time jumps if they share tzinfo object.
<TD>     = <TD>    * <real>                 # Also: <TD> = abs(<TD>) and <TD> = <TD> ±% <TD>.
<float>  = <TD>    / <TD>                   # How many weeks/years there are in TD. Also //.
Arguments
Inside Function Call
func(<positional_args>)                           # func(0, 0)
func(<keyword_args>)                              # func(x=0, y=0)
func(<positional_args>, <keyword_args>)           # func(0, y=0)
Inside Function Definition
def func(<nondefault_args>): ...                  # def func(x, y): ...
def func(<default_args>): ...                     # def func(x=0, y=0): ...
def func(<nondefault_args>, <default_args>): ...  # def func(x, y=0): ...
Default values are evaluated when function is first encountered in the scope.
Any mutation of a mutable default value will persist between invocations.
Splat Operator
Inside Function Call
Splat expands a collection into positional arguments, while splatty-splat expands a dictionary into keyword arguments.

args   = (1, 2)
kwargs = {'x': 3, 'y': 4, 'z': 5}
func(*args, **kwargs)
Is the same as:
func(1, 2, x=3, y=4, z=5)
Inside Function Definition
Splat combines zero or more positional arguments into a tuple, while splatty-splat combines zero or more keyword arguments into a dictionary.

def add(*a):
    return sum(a)
>>> add(1, 2, 3)

Named Tuple, Enum, Dataclass
from collections import namedtuple
Point = namedtuple('Point', 'x y')                  # Creates a tuple's subclass.
point = Point(0, 0)                                 # Returns its instance.
from enum import Enum
Direction = Enum('Direction', 'n e s w')            # Creates an enum.
direction = Direction.n                             # Returns its member.
from dataclasses import make_dataclass
Player = make_dataclass('Player', ['loc', 'dir'])   # Creates a class.
player = Player(point, direction)                   # Returns its instance.
Imports
import <module>            # Imports a built-in or '<module>.py'.
import <package>           # Imports a built-in or '<package>/__init__.py'.
import <package>.<module>  # Imports a built-in or '<package>/<module>.py'.
Package is a collection of modules, but it can also define its own objects.
On a filesystem this corresponds to a directory of Python files with an optional init script.
Running 'import <package>' does not automatically provide access to the package's modules unless they are explicitly imported in its init script.
Closure
We have/get a closure in Python when:

A nested function references a value of its enclosing function and then
the enclosing function returns the nested function.
def get_multiplier(a):
    def out(b):
        return a * b
    return out
>>> multiply_by_3 = get_multiplier(3)
>>> multiply_by_3(10)
30
If multiple nested functions within enclosing function reference the same value, that value gets shared.
To dynamically access function's first free variable use '<function>.__closure__[0].cell_contents'.
Partial
from functools import partial
<function> = partial(<function> [, <arg_1>, <arg_2>, ...])
>>> import operator as op
>>> multiply_by_3 = partial(op.mul, 3)
>>> multiply_by_3(10)
30
Partial is also useful in cases when function needs to be passed as an argument because it enables us to set its arguments beforehand.
A few examples being: 'defaultdict(<function>)', 'iter(<function>, to_exclusive)' and dataclass's 'field(default_factory=<function>)'.
Non-Local
If variable is being assigned to anywhere in the scope, it is regarded as a local variable, unless it is declared as a 'global' or a 'nonlocal'.

def get_counter():
    i = 0
    def out():
        nonlocal i
        i += 1
        return i
    return out
>>> counter = get_counter()
>>> counter(), counter(), counter()
(1, 2, 3)
Decorator
A decorator takes a function, adds some functionality and returns it.
It can be any callable, but is usually implemented as a function that returns a closure.
@decorator_name
def function_that_gets_passed_to_decorator():
    ...
Debugger Example
Decorator that prints function's name every time the function is called.

from functools import wraps

def debug(func):
    @wraps(func)
    def out(*args, **kwargs):
        print(func.__name__)
        return func(*args, **kwargs)
    return out

@debug
def add(x, y):
    return x + y
Wraps is a helper decorator that copies the metadata of the passed function (func) to the function it is wrapping (out).
Without it 'add.__name__' would return 'out'.
LRU Cache
Decorator that caches function's return values. All function's arguments must be hashable.

from functools import lru_cache

@lru_cache(maxsize=None)
def fib(n):
    return n if n < 2 else fib(n-2) + fib(n-1)
Default size of the cache is 128 values. Passing 'maxsize=None' makes it unbounded.
CPython interpreter limits recursion depth to 1000 by default. To increase it use 'sys.setrecursionlimit(<depth>)'.
Parametrized Decorator
A decorator that accepts arguments and returns a normal decorator that accepts a function.

from functools import wraps

def debug(print_result=False):
    def decorator(func):
        @wraps(func)
        def out(*args, **kwargs):
            result = func(*args, **kwargs)
            print(func.__name__, result if print_result else '')
            return result
        return out
    return decorator

@debug(print_result=True)
def add(x, y):
    return x + y
Using only '@debug' to decorate the add() function would not work here, because debug would then receive the add() function as a 'print_result' argument. Decorators can however manually check if the argument they received is a function and act accordingly.
Class
class <name>:
    def __init__(self, a):
        self.a = a
    def __repr__(self):
        class_name = self.__class__.__name__
        return f'{class_name}({self.a!r})'
    def __str__(self):
        return str(self.a)

    @classmethod
    def get_class_name(cls):
        return cls.__name__
Return value of repr() should be unambiguous and of str() readable.
If only repr() is defined, it will also be used for str().
Methods decorated with '@staticmethod' do not receive 'self' nor 'cls' as their first arg.
Str() use cases:
print(<el>)
f'{<el>}'
logging.warning(<el>)
csv.writer(<file>).writerow([<el>])
raise Exception(<el>)
Repr() use cases:
print/str/repr([<el>])
f'{<el>!r}'
Z = dataclasses.make_dataclass('Z', ['a']); print/str/repr(Z(<el>))
>>> <el>
Constructor Overloading
class <name>:
    def __init__(self, a=None):
        self.a = a
Inheritance
class Person:
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.name = name
        self.age  = age

class Employee(Person):
    def __init__(self, name, age, staff_num):
        super().__init__(name, age)
        self.staff_num = staff_num
Multiple Inheritance
class A: pass
class B: pass
class C(A, B): pass
MRO determines the order in which parent classes are traversed when searching for a method or an attribute:

>>> C.mro()
[<class 'C'>, <class 'A'>, <class 'B'>, <class 'object'>]
Property
Pythonic way of implementing getters and setters.

class Person:
    @property
    def name(self):
        return ' '.join(self._name)

    @name.setter
    def name(self, value):
        self._name = value.split()
>>> person = Person()
>>> person.name = '\t Guido  van Rossum \n'
>>> person.name
'Guido van Rossum'
Dataclass
Decorator that automatically generates init(), repr() and eq() special methods.

from dataclasses import dataclass, field

@dataclass(order=False, frozen=False)
class <class_name>:
    <attr_name_1>: <type>
    <attr_name_2>: <type> = <default_value>
    <attr_name_3>: list/dict/set = field(default_factory=list/dict/set)
Objects can be made sortable with 'order=True' and immutable with 'frozen=True'.
For object to be hashable, all attributes must be hashable and 'frozen' must be True.
Function field() is needed because '<attr_name>: list = []' would make a list that is shared among all instances. Its 'default_factory' argument can be any callable.
For attributes of arbitrary type use 'typing.Any'.
Inline:
from dataclasses import make_dataclass
<class> = make_dataclass('<class_name>', <coll_of_attribute_names>)
<class> = make_dataclass('<class_name>', <coll_of_tuples>)
<tuple> = ('<attr_name>', <type> [, <default_value>])
Rest of type annotations (CPython interpreter ignores them all):
def func(<arg_name>: <type> [= <obj>]) -> <type>: ...
<var_name>: typing.List/Set/Iterable/Sequence/Optional[<type>]
<var_name>: typing.Dict/Tuple/Union[<type>, ...]
Slots
Mechanism that restricts objects to attributes listed in 'slots' and significantly reduces their memory footprint.

class MyClassWithSlots:
    __slots__ = ['a']
    def __init__(self):
        self.a = 1
Copy
from copy import copy, deepcopy
<object> = copy(<object>)
<object> = deepcopy(<object>)
Duck Types
A duck type is an implicit type that prescribes a set of special methods. Any object that has those methods defined is considered a member of that duck type.

Comparable
If eq() method is not overridden, it returns 'id(self) == id(other)', which is the same as 'self is other'.
That means all objects compare not equal by default.
Only the left side object has eq() method called, unless it returns NotImplemented, in which case the right object is consulted. False is returned if both return NotImplemented.
Ne() automatically works on any object that has eq() defined.
class MyComparable:
    def __init__(self, a):
        self.a = a
    def __eq__(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, type(self)):
            return self.a == other.a
        return NotImplemented
Hashable
Hashable object needs both hash() and eq() methods and its hash value should never change.
Hashable objects that compare equal must have the same hash value, meaning default hash() that returns 'id(self)' will not do.
That is why Python automatically makes classes unhashable if you only implement eq().
class MyHashable:
    def __init__(self, a):
        self._a = a
    @property
    def a(self):
        return self._a
    def __eq__(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, type(self)):
            return self.a == other.a
        return NotImplemented
    def __hash__(self):
        return hash(self.a)
Sortable
With 'total_ordering' decorator, you only need to provide eq() and one of lt(), gt(), le() or ge() special methods and the rest will be automatically generated.
Functions sorted() and min() only require lt() method, while max() only requires gt(). However, it is best to define them all so that confusion doesn't arise in other contexts.
When two lists, strings or dataclasses are compared, their values get compared in order until a pair of unequal values is found. The comparison of this two values is then returned. The shorter sequence is considered smaller in case of all values being equal.
from functools import total_ordering

@total_ordering
class MySortable:
    def __init__(self, a):
        self.a = a
    def __eq__(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, type(self)):
            return self.a == other.a
        return NotImplemented
    def __lt__(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, type(self)):
            return self.a < other.a
        return NotImplemented
Iterator
Any object that has methods next() and iter() is an iterator.
Next() should return next item or raise StopIteration.
Iter() should return 'self'.
class Counter:
    def __init__(self):
        self.i = 0
    def __next__(self):
        self.i += 1
        return self.i
    def __iter__(self):
        return self
>>> counter = Counter()
>>> next(counter), next(counter), next(counter)
(1, 2, 3)
Python has many different iterator objects:
Sequence iterators returned by the iter() function, such as list_iterator and set_iterator.
Objects returned by the itertools module, such as count, repeat and cycle.
Generators returned by the generator functions and generator expressions.
File objects returned by the open() function, etc.
Callable
All functions and classes have a call() method, hence are callable.
When this cheatsheet uses '<function>' as an argument, it actually means '<callable>'.
class Counter:
    def __init__(self):
        self.i = 0
    def __call__(self):
        self.i += 1
        return self.i
>>> counter = Counter()
>>> counter(), counter(), counter()
(1, 2, 3)
Context Manager
Enter() should lock the resources and optionally return an object.
Exit() should release the resources.
Any exception that happens inside the with block is passed to the exit() method.
If it wishes to suppress the exception it must return a true value.
class MyOpen:
    def __init__(self, filename):
        self.filename = filename
    def __enter__(self):
        self.file = open(self.filename)
        return self.file
    def __exit__(self, exc_type, exception, traceback):
        self.file.close()
>>> with open('test.txt', 'w') as file:
...     file.write('Hello World!')
>>> with MyOpen('test.txt') as file:
...     print(file.read())
Hello World!
Iterable Duck Types
Iterable
Only required method is iter(). It should return an iterator of object's items.
Contains() automatically works on any object that has iter() defined.
class MyIterable:
    def __init__(self, a):
        self.a = a
    def __iter__(self):
        return iter(self.a)
    def __contains__(self, el):
        return el in self.a
>>> obj = MyIterable([1, 2, 3])
>>> [el for el in obj]
[1, 2, 3]
>>> 1 in obj
True
Collection
Only required methods are iter() and len(). Len() should return the number of items.
This cheatsheet actually means '<iterable>' when it uses '<collection>'.
I chose not to use the name 'iterable' because it sounds scarier and more vague than 'collection'. The only drawback of this decision is that a reader could think a certain function doesn't accept iterators when it does, since iterators are the only built-in objects that are iterable but are not collections.
class MyCollection:
    def __init__(self, a):
        self.a = a
    def __iter__(self):
        return iter(self.a)
    def __contains__(self, el):
        return el in self.a
    def __len__(self):
        return len(self.a)
Sequence
Only required methods are len() and getitem().
Getitem() should return an item at the passed index or raise IndexError.
Iter() and contains() automatically work on any object that has getitem() defined.
Reversed() automatically works on any object that has len() and getitem() defined.
class MySequence:
    def __init__(self, a):
        self.a = a
    def __iter__(self):
        return iter(self.a)
    def __contains__(self, el):
        return el in self.a
    def __len__(self):
        return len(self.a)
    def __getitem__(self, i):
        return self.a[i]
    def __reversed__(self):
        return reversed(self.a)
Discrepancies between glossary definitions and abstract base classes:
Glossary defines iterable as any object with iter() or getitem() and sequence as any object with getitem() and len(). It does not define collection.
Passing ABC Iterable to isinstance() or issubclass() checks whether object/class has method iter(), while ABC Collection checks for iter(), contains() and len().
ABC Sequence
It's a richer interface than the basic sequence.
Extending it generates iter(), contains(), reversed(), index() and count().
Unlike 'abc.Iterable' and 'abc.Collection', it is not a duck type. That is why 'issubclass(MySequence, abc.Sequence)' would return False even if MySequence had all the methods defined. It however recognizes list, tuple, range, str, bytes, bytearray, memoryview and deque, because they are registered as Sequence's virtual subclasses.
from collections import abc

class MyAbcSequence(abc.Sequence):
    def __init__(self, a):
        self.a = a
    def __len__(self):
        return len(self.a)
    def __getitem__(self, i):
        return self.a[i]
Table of required and automatically available special methods:
+------------+------------+------------+------------+--------------+
|            |  Iterable  | Collection |  Sequence  | abc.Sequence |
+------------+------------+------------+------------+--------------+
| iter()     |    REQ     |    REQ     |    Yes     |     Yes      |
| contains() |    Yes     |    Yes     |    Yes     |     Yes      |
| len()      |            |    REQ     |    REQ     |     REQ      |
| getitem()  |            |            |    REQ     |     REQ      |
| reversed() |            |            |    Yes     |     Yes      |
| index()    |            |            |            |     Yes      |
| count()    |            |            |            |     Yes      |
+------------+------------+------------+------------+--------------+
Other ABCs that generate missing methods are: MutableSequence, Set, MutableSet, Mapping and MutableMapping.
Names of their required methods are stored in '<abc>.__abstractmethods__'.
Enum
from enum import Enum, auto
class <enum_name>(Enum):
    <member_name_1> = <value_1>
    <member_name_2> = <value_2_a>, <value_2_b>
    <member_name_3> = auto()
If there are no numeric values before auto(), it returns 1.
Otherwise it returns an increment of the last numeric value.
<member> = <enum>.<member_name>                 # Returns a member.
<member> = <enum>['<member_name>']              # Returns a member or raises KeyError.
<member> = <enum>(<value>)                      # Returns a member or raises ValueError.
<str>    = <member>.name                        # Returns member's name.
<obj>    = <member>.value                       # Returns member's value.
list_of_members = list(<enum>)
member_names    = [a.name for a in <enum>]
member_values   = [a.value for a in <enum>]
random_member   = random.choice(list(<enum>))
def get_next_member(member):
    members = list(member.__class__)
    index   = (members.index(member) + 1) % len(members)
    return members[index]
Inline
Cutlery = Enum('Cutlery', 'fork knife spoon')
Cutlery = Enum('Cutlery', ['fork', 'knife', 'spoon'])
Cutlery = Enum('Cutlery', {'fork': 1, 'knife': 2, 'spoon': 3})
User-defined functions cannot be values, so they must be wrapped:
from functools import partial
LogicOp = Enum('LogicOp', {'AND': partial(lambda l, r: l and r),
                           'OR':  partial(lambda l, r: l or r)})
Member names are in all caps because trying to access a member that is named after a reserved keyword raises SyntaxError.
Exceptions
try:
    <code>
except <exception>:
    <code>
Complex Example
try:
    <code_1>
except <exception_a>:
    <code_2_a>
except <exception_b>:
    <code_2_b>
else:
    <code_2_c>
finally:
    <code_3>
Code inside the 'else' block will only be executed if 'try' block had no exceptions.
Code inside the 'finally' block will always be executed (unless a signal is received).
Catching Exceptions
except <exception>: ...
except <exception> as <name>: ...
except (<exception>, [...]): ...
except (<exception>, [...]) as <name>: ...
Also catches subclasses of the exception.
Use 'traceback.print_exc()' to print the error message to stderr.
Use 'print(<name>)' to print just the cause of the exception (its arguments).
Use 'logging.exception(<message>)' to log the exception.
Raising Exceptions
raise <exception>
raise <exception>()
raise <exception>(<el> [, ...])
Re-raising caught exception:
except <exception> as <name>:
    ...
    raise

User-defined Exceptions
class MyError(Exception): pass
class MyInputError(MyError): pass
Exit
Exits the interpreter by raising SystemExit exception.

import sys
sys.exit()                        # Exits with exit code 0 (success).
sys.exit(<el>)                    # Prints to stderr and exits with 1.
sys.exit(<int>)                   # Exits with passed exit code.
Print
print(<el_1>, ..., sep=' ', end='\n', file=sys.stdout, flush=False)
Use 'file=sys.stderr' for messages about errors.
Use 'flush=True' to forcibly flush the stream.
Pretty Print
from pprint import pprint
pprint(<collection>, width=80, depth=None, compact=False, sort_dicts=True)
Levels deeper than 'depth' get replaced by '...'.
Input
Reads a line from user input or pipe if present.

<str> = input(prompt=None)
Trailing newline gets stripped.
Prompt string is printed to the standard output before reading input.
Raises EOFError when user hits EOF (ctrl-d/ctrl-z⏎) or input stream gets exhausted.
Command Line Arguments
import sys
scripts_path = sys.argv[0]
arguments    = sys.argv[1:]
Argument Parser
from argparse import ArgumentParser, FileType
p = ArgumentParser(description=<str>)
p.add_argument('-<short_name>', '--<name>', action='store_true')  # Flag.
p.add_argument('-<short_name>', '--<name>', type=<type>)          # Option.
p.add_argument('<name>', type=<type>, nargs=1)                    # First argument.
p.add_argument('<name>', type=<type>, nargs='+')                  # Remaining arguments.
p.add_argument('<name>', type=<type>, nargs='*')                  # Optional arguments.
args  = p.parse_args()                                            # Exits on error.
value = args.<name>
Use 'help=<str>' to set argument description that will be displayed in help message.
Use 'default=<el>' to set the default value.
Use 'type=FileType(<mode>)' for files. Accepts 'encoding', but 'newline' is None.
Open
Opens the file and returns a corresponding file object.

<file> = open(<path>, mode='r', encoding=None, newline=None)
'encoding=None' means that the default encoding is used, which is platform dependent. Best practice is to use 'encoding=""utf-8""' whenever possible.
'newline=None' means all different end of line combinations are converted to '\n' on read, while on write all '\n' characters are converted to system's default line separator.
'newline=""""' means no conversions take place, but input is still broken into chunks by readline() and readlines() on every '\n', '\r' and '\r\n'.
Modes
'r' - Read (default).
'w' - Write (truncate).
'x' - Write or fail if the file already exists.
'a' - Append.
'w+' - Read and write (truncate).
'r+' - Read and write from the start.
'a+' - Read and write from the end.
't' - Text mode (default).
'b' - Binary mode ('br', 'bw', 'bx', …).
Exceptions
'FileNotFoundError' can be raised when reading with 'r' or 'r+'.
'FileExistsError' can be raised when writing with 'x'.
'IsADirectoryError' and 'PermissionError' can be raised by any.
'OSError' is the parent class of all listed exceptions.
File Object
<file>.seek(0)                      # Moves to the start of the file.
<file>.seek(offset)                 # Moves 'offset' chars/bytes from the start.
<file>.seek(0, 2)                   # Moves to the end of the file.
<bin_file>.seek(±offset, <anchor>)  # Anchor: 0 start, 1 current position, 2 end.
<str/bytes> = <file>.read(size=-1)  # Reads 'size' chars/bytes or until EOF.
<str/bytes> = <file>.readline()     # Returns a line or empty string/bytes on EOF.
<list>      = <file>.readlines()    # Returns a list of remaining lines.
<str/bytes> = next(<file>)          # Returns a line using buffer. Do not mix.
<file>.write(<str/bytes>)           # Writes a string or bytes object.
<file>.writelines(<collection>)     # Writes a coll. of strings or bytes objects.
<file>.flush()                      # Flushes write buffer. Runs every 4096/8192 B.
Methods do not add or strip trailing newlines, even writelines().
Read Text from File
def read_file(filename):
    with open(filename, encoding='utf-8') as file:
        return file.readlines()
Write Text to File
def write_to_file(filename, text):
    with open(filename, 'w', encoding='utf-8') as file:
        file.write(text)
Paths
from os import getcwd, path, listdir, scandir
from glob import glob
<str>  = getcwd()                   # Returns the current working directory.
<str>  = path.join(<path>, ...)     # Joins two or more pathname components.
<str>  = path.abspath(<path>)       # Returns absolute path.
<str>  = path.basename(<path>)      # Returns final component of the path.
<str>  = path.dirname(<path>)       # Returns path without the final component.
<tup.> = path.splitext(<path>)      # Splits on last period of the final component.
<list> = listdir(path='.')          # Returns filenames located at path.
<list> = glob('<pattern>')          # Returns paths matching the wildcard pattern.
<bool> = path.exists(<path>)        # Or: <Path>.exists()
<bool> = path.isfile(<path>)        # Or: <DirEntry/Path>.is_file()
<bool> = path.isdir(<path>)         # Or: <DirEntry/Path>.is_dir()
<stat> = os.stat(<path>)            # Or: <DirEntry/Path>.stat()
<real> = <stat>.st_mtime/st_size/…  # Modification time, size in bytes, …
DirEntry
Unlike listdir(), scandir() returns DirEntry objects that cache isfile, isdir and on Windows also stat information, thus significantly increasing the performance of code that requires it.

<iter> = scandir(path='.')          # Returns DirEntry objects located at path.
<str>  = <DirEntry>.path            # Returns whole path as a string.
<str>  = <DirEntry>.name            # Returns final component as a string.
<file> = open(<DirEntry>)           # Opens the file and returns a file object.
Path Object
from pathlib import Path
<Path> = Path(<path> [, ...])       # Accepts strings, Paths and DirEntry objects.
<Path> = <path> / <path> [/ ...]    # First or second path must be a Path object.
<Path> = Path()                     # Returns relative cwd. Also Path('.').
<Path> = Path.cwd()                 # Returns absolute cwd. Also Path().resolve().
<Path> = Path.home()                # Returns user's home directory (absolute).
<Path> = Path(__file__).resolve()   # Returns script's path if cwd wasn't changed.
<Path> = <Path>.parent              # Returns Path without the final component.
<str>  = <Path>.name                # Returns final component as a string.
<str>  = <Path>.stem                # Returns final component without extension.
<str>  = <Path>.suffix              # Returns final component's extension.
<tup.> = <Path>.parts               # Returns all components as strings.
<iter> = <Path>.iterdir()           # Returns directory contents as Path objects.
<iter> = <Path>.glob('<pattern>')   # Returns Paths matching the wildcard pattern.
<str>  = str(<Path>)                # Returns path as a string.
<file> = open(<Path>)               # Also <Path>.read/write_text/bytes().
OS Commands
import os, shutil, subprocess
os.chdir(<path>)                 # Changes the current working directory.
os.mkdir(<path>, mode=0o777)     # Creates a directory. Mode is in octal.
os.makedirs(<path>, mode=0o777)  # Creates all path's dirs. Also: `exist_ok=False`.
shutil.copy(from, to)            # Copies the file. 'to' can exist or be a dir.
shutil.copytree(from, to)        # Copies the directory. 'to' must not exist.
os.rename(from, to)              # Renames/moves the file or directory.
os.replace(from, to)             # Same, but overwrites 'to' if it exists.
os.remove(<path>)                # Deletes the file.
os.rmdir(<path>)                 # Deletes the empty directory.
shutil.rmtree(<path>)            # Deletes the directory.
Paths can be either strings, Paths or DirEntry objects.
Functions report OS related errors by raising either OSError or one of its subclasses.
Shell Commands
<pipe> = os.popen('<command>')   # Executes command in sh/cmd and returns its stdout pipe.
<str>  = <pipe>.read(size=-1)    # Reads 'size' chars or until EOF. Also readline/s().
<int>  = <pipe>.close()          # Closes the pipe. Returns None on success, int on error.
Sends '1 + 1' to the basic calculator and captures its output:
>>> subprocess.run('bc', input='1 + 1\n', capture_output=True, text=True)
CompletedProcess(args='bc', returncode=0, stdout='2\n', stderr='')
Sends test.in to the basic calculator running in standard mode and saves its output to test.out:
>>> from shlex import split
>>> os.popen('echo 1 + 1 > test.in')
>>> subprocess.run(split('bc -s'), stdin=open('test.in'), stdout=open('test.out', 'w'))
CompletedProcess(args=['bc', '-s'], returncode=0)
>>> open('test.out').read()
'2\n'

Read Object from JSON File
def read_json_file(filename):
    with open(filename, encoding='utf-8') as file:
        return json.load(file)

CSV
Text file format for storing spreadsheets.

import csv
Read
<reader> = csv.reader(<file>)       # Also: `dialect='excel', delimiter=','`.
<list>   = next(<reader>)           # Returns next row as a list of strings.
<list>   = list(<reader>)           # Returns a list of remaining rows.
File must be opened with a 'newline=""""' argument, or newlines embedded inside quoted fields will not be interpreted correctly!
To print the spreadsheet to the console use Tabulate library.
For XML and binary Excel files (xlsx, xlsm and xlsb) use Pandas library.
Write
<writer> = csv.writer(<file>)       # Also: `dialect='excel', delimiter=','`.
<writer>.writerow(<collection>)     # Encodes objects using `str(<el>)`.
<writer>.writerows(<coll_of_coll>)  # Appends multiple rows.
File must be opened with a 'newline=""""' argument, or '\r' will be added in front of every '\n' on platforms that use '\r\n' line endings!
Parameters
'dialect' - Master parameter that sets the default values. String or a Dialect object.
'delimiter' - A one-character string used to separate fields.
'quotechar' - Character for quoting fields that contain special characters.
'doublequote' - Whether quotechars inside fields are/get doubled or escaped.
'skipinitialspace' - Is space character at the start of the field stripped by the reader.
'lineterminator' - How writer terminates rows. Reader is hardcoded to '\n', '\r', '\r\n'.
'quoting' - 0: As necessary, 1: All, 2: All but numbers which are read as floats, 3: None.
'escapechar' - Character for escaping quotechars if doublequote is False.

SQLite
A server-less database engine that stores each database into a separate file.

Connect
Opens a connection to the database file. Creates a new file if path doesn't exist.

import sqlite3
<conn> = sqlite3.connect(<path>)                # Also ':memory:'.
<conn>.close()                                  # Closes the connection.
Read
Returned values can be of type str, int, float, bytes or None.

<cursor> = <conn>.execute('<query>')            # Can raise a subclass of sqlite3.Error.
<tuple>  = <cursor>.fetchone()                  # Returns next row. Also next(<cursor>).
<list>   = <cursor>.fetchall()                  # Returns remaining rows. Also list(<cursor>).
Write
<conn>.execute('<query>')                       # Can raise a subclass of sqlite3.Error.
<conn>.commit()                                 # Saves all changes since the last commit.
<conn>.rollback()                               # Discards all changes since the last commit.
Or:
with <conn>:                                    # Exits the block with commit() or rollback(),
    <conn>.execute('<query>')                   # depending on whether any exception occurred.
Placeholders
Passed values can be of type str, int, float, bytes, None, bool, datetime.date or datetime.datetime.
Bools will be stored and returned as ints and dates as ISO formatted strings.
<conn>.execute('<query>', <list/tuple>)         # Replaces '?'s in query with values.
<conn>.execute('<query>', <dict/namedtuple>)    # Replaces ':<key>'s with values.
<conn>.executemany('<query>', <coll_of_above>)  # Runs execute() multiple times.

Values are not actually saved in this example because 'conn.commit()' is omitted!

>>> conn = sqlite3.connect('test.db')
>>> conn.execute('CREATE TABLE person (person_id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, name, height)')
>>> conn.execute('INSERT INTO person VALUES (NULL, ?, ?)', ('Jean-Luc', 187)).lastrowid
1
>>> conn.execute('SELECT * FROM person').fetchall()
[(1, 'Jean-Luc', 187)]
MySQL
Has a very similar interface, with differences listed below.

# $ pip3 install mysql-connector
from mysql import connector
<conn>   = connector.connect(host=<str>, …)     # `user=<str>, password=<str>, database=<str>`.
<cursor> = <conn>.cursor()                      # Only cursor has execute() method.
<cursor>.execute('<query>')                     # Can raise a subclass of connector.Error.
<cursor>.execute('<query>', <list/tuple>)       # Replaces '%s's in query with values.
<cursor>.execute('<query>', <dict/namedtuple>)  # Replaces '%(<key>)s's with values.
Bytes
Bytes object is an immutable sequence of single bytes. Mutable version is called bytearray.

<bytes> = b'<str>'                          # Only accepts ASCII characters and \x00-\xff.
<int>   = <bytes>[<index>]                  # Returns an int in range from 0 to 255.
<bytes> = <bytes>[<slice>]                  # Returns bytes even if it has only one element.
<bytes> = <bytes>.join(<coll_of_bytes>)     # Joins elements using bytes as a separator.
Encode
<bytes> = bytes(<coll_of_ints>)             # Ints must be in range from 0 to 255.
<bytes> = bytes(<str>, 'utf-8')             # Or: <str>.encode('utf-8')
<bytes> = <int>.to_bytes(n_bytes, …)        # `byteorder='little/big', signed=False`.
<bytes> = bytes.fromhex('<hex>')            # Hex pairs can be separated by whitespaces.
Decode
<list>  = list(<bytes>)                     # Returns ints in range from 0 to 255.
<str>   = str(<bytes>, 'utf-8')             # Or: <bytes>.decode('utf-8')
<int>   = int.from_bytes(<bytes>, …)        # `byteorder='little/big', signed=False`.
'<hex>' = <bytes>.hex()                     # Returns hex pairs. Accepts `sep=<str>`.
Read Bytes from File
def read_bytes(filename):
    with open(filename, 'rb') as file:
        return file.read()
Write Bytes to File
def write_bytes(filename, bytes_obj):
    with open(filename, 'wb') as file:
        file.write(bytes_obj)
Struct
Module that performs conversions between a sequence of numbers and a bytes object.
System’s type sizes, byte order, and alignment rules are used by default.
from struct import pack, unpack
<bytes> = pack('<format>', <el_1> [, ...])  # Packages arguments into bytes object.
<tuple> = unpack('<format>', <bytes>)       # Use iter_unpack() for iterator of tuples.
>>> pack('>hhl', 1, 2, 3)
b'\x00\x01\x00\x02\x00\x00\x00\x03'
>>> unpack('>hhl', b'\x00\x01\x00\x02\x00\x00\x00\x03')
(1, 2, 3)
Format
For standard type sizes and manual alignment (padding) start format string with:
'=' - System's byte order (usually little-endian).
'<' - Little-endian.
'>' - Big-endian (also '!').
Besides numbers, pack() and unpack() also support bytes objects as part of the sequence:
'c' - A bytes object with a single element. For pad byte use 'x'.
'<n>s' - A bytes object with n elements.
Integer types. Use a capital letter for unsigned type. Minimum and standard sizes are in brackets:
'b' - char (1/1)
'h' - short (2/2)
'i' - int (2/4)
'l' - long (4/4)
'q' - long long (8/8)
Floating point types:
'f' - float (4/4)
'd' - double (8/8)
Array
List that can only hold numbers of a predefined type. Available types and their minimum sizes in bytes are listed above. Sizes and byte order are always determined by the system.

from array import array
<array> = array('<typecode>', <collection>)    # Array from collection of numbers.
<array> = array('<typecode>', <bytes>)         # Array from bytes object.
<array> = array('<typecode>', <array>)         # Treats array as a sequence of numbers.
<bytes> = bytes(<array>)                       # Or: <array>.tobytes()
<file>.write(<array>)                          # Writes array to the binary file.
Memory View
A sequence object that points to the memory of another object.
Each element can reference a single or multiple consecutive bytes, depending on format.
Order and number of elements can be changed with slicing.
Casting only works between char and other types and uses system's sizes.
Byte order is always determined by the system.
<mview> = memoryview(<bytes/bytearray/array>)  # Immutable if bytes, else mutable.
<real>  = <mview>[<index>]                     # Returns an int or a float.
<mview> = <mview>[<slice>]                     # Mview with rearranged elements.
<mview> = <mview>.cast('<typecode>')           # Casts memoryview to the new format.
<mview>.release()                              # Releases the object's memory buffer.
Decode
<bytes> = bytes(<mview>)                       # Returns a new bytes object.
<bytes> = <bytes>.join(<coll_of_mviews>)       # Joins mviews using bytes object as sep.
<array> = array('<typecode>', <mview>)         # Treats mview as a sequence of numbers.
<file>.write(<mview>)                          # Writes mview to the binary file.
<list>  = list(<mview>)                        # Returns a list of ints or floats.
<str>   = str(<mview>, 'utf-8')                # Treats mview as a bytes object.
<int>   = int.from_bytes(<mview>, …)           # `byteorder='little/big', signed=False`.
'<hex>' = <mview>.hex()                        # Treats mview as a bytes object.
Deque
A thread-safe list with efficient appends and pops from either side. Pronounced ""deck"".

from collections import deque
<deque> = deque(<collection>, maxlen=None)
<deque>.appendleft(<el>)                       # Opposite element is dropped if full.
<deque>.extendleft(<collection>)               # Collection gets reversed.
<el> = <deque>.popleft()                       # Raises IndexError if empty.
<deque>.rotate(n=1)                            # Rotates elements to the right.
Threading
CPython interpreter can only run a single thread at a time.
That is why using multiple threads won't result in a faster execution, unless at least one of the threads contains an I/O operation.
from threading import Thread, RLock, Semaphore, Event, Barrier
from concurrent.futures import ThreadPoolExecutor
Thread
<Thread> = Thread(target=<function>)           # Use `args=<collection>` to set the arguments.
<Thread>.start()                               # Starts the thread.
<bool> = <Thread>.is_alive()                   # Checks if the thread has finished executing.
<Thread>.join()                                # Waits for the thread to finish.
Use 'kwargs=<dict>' to pass keyword arguments to the function.
Use 'daemon=True', or the program will not be able to exit while the thread is alive.
Lock
<lock> = RLock()                               # Lock that can only be released by acquirer.
<lock>.acquire()                               # Waits for the lock to be available.
<lock>.release()                               # Makes the lock available again.
Or:
with <lock>:                                   # Enters the block by calling acquire(),
    ...                                        # and exits it with release().
Semaphore, Event, Barrier
<Semaphore> = Semaphore(value=1)               # Lock that can be acquired by 'value' threads.
<Event>     = Event()                          # Method wait() blocks until set() is called.
<Barrier>   = Barrier(n_times)                 # Wait() blocks until it's called n_times.
Thread Pool Executor
Object that manages thread execution.
An object with the same interface called ProcessPoolExecutor provides true parallelism by running a separate interpreter in each process. All arguments must be pickable.
<Exec> = ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=None)  # Or: `with ThreadPoolExecutor() as <name>: …`
<Exec>.shutdown(wait=True)                     # Blocks until all threads finish executing.
<iter> = <Exec>.map(<func>, <args_1>, ...)     # A multithreaded and non-lazy map().
<Futr> = <Exec>.submit(<func>, <arg_1>, ...)   # Starts a thread and returns its Future object.
<bool> = <Futr>.done()                         # Checks if the thread has finished executing.
<obj>  = <Futr>.result()                       # Waits for thread to finish and returns result.
Queue
A thread-safe FIFO queue. For LIFO queue use LifoQueue.

from queue import Queue
<Queue> = Queue(maxsize=0)
<Queue>.put(<el>)                              # Blocks until queue stops being full.
<Queue>.put_nowait(<el>)                       # Raises queue.Full exception if full.
<el> = <Queue>.get()                           # Blocks until queue stops being empty.
<el> = <Queue>.get_nowait()                    # Raises queue.Empty exception if empty.
Operator
Module of functions that provide the functionality of operators.

import operator as op
<el>      = op.add/sub/mul/truediv/floordiv/mod(<el>, <el>)  # +, -, *, /, //, %
<int/set> = op.and_/or_/xor(<int/set>, <int/set>)            # &, |, ^
<bool>    = op.eq/ne/lt/le/gt/ge(<sortable>, <sortable>)     # ==, !=, <, <=, >, >=
<func>    = op.itemgetter/attrgetter/methodcaller(<obj>)     # [index/key], .name, .name()
elementwise_sum  = map(op.add, list_a, list_b)
sorted_by_second = sorted(<collection>, key=op.itemgetter(1))
sorted_by_both   = sorted(<collection>, key=op.itemgetter(1, 0))
product_of_elems = functools.reduce(op.mul, <collection>)
union_of_sets    = functools.reduce(op.or_, <coll_of_sets>)
first_element    = op.methodcaller('pop', 0)(<list>)
Binary operators require objects to have and(), or(), xor() and invert() special methods, unlike logical operators that work on all types of objects.
Also: '<bool> = <bool> &|^ <bool>' and '<int> = <bool> &|^ <int>'.
Introspection
Inspecting code at runtime.

Variables
<list> = dir()                             # Names of local variables (incl. functions).
<dict> = vars()                            # Dict of local variables. Also locals().
<dict> = globals()                         # Dict of global variables.
Attributes
<list> = dir(<object>)                     # Names of object's attributes (incl. methods).
<dict> = vars(<object>)                    # Dict of writable attributes. Also <obj>.__dict__.
<bool> = hasattr(<object>, '<attr_name>')  # Checks if getattr() raises an AttributeError.
value  = getattr(<object>, '<attr_name>')  # Raises AttributeError if attribute is missing.
setattr(<object>, '<attr_name>', value)    # Only works on objects with '__dict__' attribute.
delattr(<object>, '<attr_name>')           # Same. Also `del <object>.<attr_name>`.
Parameters
<Sig>  = inspect.signature(<function>)     # Function's Signature object.
<dict> = <Sig>.parameters                  # Dict of Parameter objects.
<memb> = <Param>.kind                      # Member of ParameterKind enum.
<obj>  = <Param>.default                   # Default value or <Param>.empty.
<type> = <Param>.annotation                # Type or <Param>.empty.
Metaprogramming
Code that generates code.

Type
Type is the root class. If only passed an object it returns its type (class). Otherwise it creates a new class.

<class> = type('<class_name>', <tuple_of_parents>, <dict_of_class_attributes>)
>>> Z = type('Z', (), {'a': 'abcde', 'b': 12345})
>>> z = Z()
Meta Class
A class that creates classes.

def my_meta_class(name, parents, attrs):
    attrs['a'] = 'abcde'
    return type(name, parents, attrs)
Or:
class MyMetaClass(type):
    def __new__(cls, name, parents, attrs):
        attrs['a'] = 'abcde'
        return type.__new__(cls, name, parents, attrs)
New() is a class method that gets called before init(). If it returns an instance of its class, then that instance gets passed to init() as a 'self' argument.
It receives the same arguments as init(), except for the first one that specifies the desired type of the returned instance (MyMetaClass in our case).
Like in our case, new() can also be called directly, usually from a new() method of a child class (def __new__(cls): return super().__new__(cls)).
The only difference between the examples above is that my_meta_class() returns a class of type type, while MyMetaClass() returns a class of type MyMetaClass.
Metaclass Attribute
Right before a class is created it checks if it has the 'metaclass' attribute defined. If not, it recursively checks if any of his parents has it defined and eventually comes to type().

class MyClass(metaclass=MyMetaClass):
    b = 12345
>>> MyClass.a, MyClass.b
('abcde', 12345)

Coroutines
Coroutines have a lot in common with threads, but unlike threads, they only give up control when they call another coroutine and they don’t use as much memory.
Coroutine definition starts with 'async' and its call with 'await'.
'asyncio.run(<coroutine>)' is the main entry point for asynchronous programs.
Functions wait(), gather() and as_completed() can be used when multiple coroutines need to be started at the same time.
Asyncio module also provides its own Queue, Event, Lock and Semaphore classes.
Runs a terminal game where you control an asterisk that must avoid numbers:
import asyncio, collections, curses, curses.textpad, enum, random

P = collections.namedtuple('P', 'x y')         # Position
D = enum.Enum('D', 'n e s w')                  # Direction

NumPy
Array manipulation mini-language. It can run up to one hundred times faster than the equivalent Python code. An even faster alternative that runs on a GPU is called CuPy.

# $ pip3 install numpy
import numpy as np
<array> = np.array(<list/list_of_lists>)                # Returns 1d/2d NumPy array.
<array> = np.zeros/ones(<shape>)                        # Also np.full(<shape>, <el>).
<array> = np.arange(from_inc, to_exc, ±step)            # Also np.linspace(start, stop, num).
<array> = np.random.randint(from_inc, to_exc, <shape>)  # Also np.random.random(<shape>).
<view>  = <array>.reshape(<shape>)                      # Also `<array>.shape = <shape>`.
<array> = <array>.flatten()                             # Collapses array into one dimension.
<view>  = <array>.squeeze()                             # Removes dimensions of length one.
<array> = <array>.sum/min/mean/var/std(axis)            # Passed dimension gets aggregated.
<array> = <array>.argmin(axis)                          # Returns indexes of smallest elements.
<array> = np.apply_along_axis(<func>, axis, <array>)    # Func can return a scalar or array.
Shape is a tuple of dimension sizes. A 100x50 RGB image has shape (50, 100, 3).
Axis is an index of the dimension that gets aggregated. Leftmost dimension has index 0. Summing the RGB image along axis 2 will return a greyscale image with shape (50, 100).
Passing a tuple of axes will chain the operations like this: '<array>.<method>(axis_1, keepdims=True).<method>(axis_2).squeeze()'.
Indexing
<el>       = <2d_array>[row_index, column_index]        # <3d_a>[table_i, row_i, column_i]
<1d_view>  = <2d_array>[row_index]                      # <3d_a>[table_i, row_i]
<1d_view>  = <2d_array>[:, column_index]                # <3d_a>[table_i, :, column_i]
<1d_array> = <2d_array>[row_indexes, column_indexes]    # <3d_a>[table_is, row_is, column_is]
<2d_array> = <2d_array>[row_indexes]                    # <3d_a>[table_is, row_is]
<2d_array> = <2d_array>[:, column_indexes]              # <3d_a>[table_is, :, column_is]
<2d_bools> = <2d_array> ><== <el>                       # <3d_array> ><== <1d_array>
<1d_array> = <2d_array>[<2d_bools>]                     # <3d_array>[<2d_bools>]
All examples also allow assignments.
Broadcasting
Broadcasting is a set of rules by which NumPy functions operate on arrays of different sizes and/or dimensions.

left  = [[0.1], [0.6], [0.8]]                           # Shape: (3, 1)
right = [ 0.1 ,  0.6 ,  0.8 ]                           # Shape: (3,)
1. If array shapes differ in length, left-pad the shorter shape with ones:
left  = [[0.1], [0.6], [0.8]]                           # Shape: (3, 1)
right = [[0.1 ,  0.6 ,  0.8]]                           # Shape: (1, 3) <- !
2. If any dimensions differ in size, expand the ones that have size 1 by duplicating their elements:
left  = [[0.1,  0.1,  0.1],                             # Shape: (3, 3) <- !
         [0.6,  0.6,  0.6],
         [0.8,  0.8,  0.8]]

right = [[0.1,  0.6,  0.8],                             # Shape: (3, 3) <- !
         [0.1,  0.6,  0.8],
         [0.1,  0.6,  0.8]]
3. If neither non-matching dimension has size 1, raise an error.
Example
For each point returns index of its nearest point ([0.1, 0.6, 0.8] => [1, 2, 1]):
>>> points = np.array([0.1, 0.6, 0.8])
 [ 0.1,  0.6,  0.8]
>>> wrapped_points = points.reshape(3, 1)
[[ 0.1],
 [ 0.6],
 [ 0.8]]
>>> distances = wrapped_points - points
[[ 0. , -0.5, -0.7],
 [ 0.5,  0. , -0.2],
 [ 0.7,  0.2,  0. ]]
>>> distances = np.abs(distances)
[[ 0. ,  0.5,  0.7],
 [ 0.5,  0. ,  0.2],
 [ 0.7,  0.2,  0. ]]
>>> i = np.arange(3)
[0, 1, 2]
>>> distances[i, i] = np.inf
[[ inf,  0.5,  0.7],
 [ 0.5,  inf,  0.2],
 [ 0.7,  0.2,  inf]]
>>> distances.argmin(1)

<Image>.show()                                   # Opens image in default preview app.
<int/tuple> = <Image>.getpixel((x, y))           # Returns a pixel.
<Image>.putpixel((x, y), <int/tuple>)            # Writes a pixel to the image.
<ImagingCore> = <Image>.getdata()                # Returns a flattened sequence of pixels.
<Image>.putdata(<list/ImagingCore>)              # Writes a flattened sequence of pixels.
<Image>.paste(<Image>, (x, y))                   # Writes passed image to the image.
<2d_array> = np.array(<Image_L>)                 # Creates NumPy array from greyscale image.
<3d_array> = np.array(<Image_RGB/A>)             # Creates NumPy array from color image.
<Image>    = Image.fromarray(np.uint8(<array>))  # Use <array>.clip(0, 255) to clip the values.
Modes
'1' - 1-bit pixels, black and white, stored with one pixel per byte.
'L' - 8-bit pixels, greyscale.
'RGB' - 3x8-bit pixels, true color.
'RGBA' - 4x8-bit pixels, true color with transparency mask.
'HSV' - 3x8-bit pixels, Hue, Saturation, Value color space.
Examples
Creates a PNG image of a rainbow gradient:
WIDTH, HEIGHT = 100, 100
n_pixels = WIDTH * HEIGHT
hues = (255 * i/n_pixels for i in range(n_pixels))
img = Image.new('HSV', (WIDTH, HEIGHT))
img.putdata([(int(h), 255, 255) for h in hues])
img.convert('RGB').save('test.png')
Adds noise to a PNG image:
from random import randint
add_noise = lambda value: max(0, min(255, value + randint(-20, 20)))
img = Image.open('test.png').convert('HSV')
img.putdata([(add_noise(h), s, v) for h, s, v in img.getdata()])
img.convert('RGB').save('test.png')
Image Draw
from PIL import ImageDraw
<ImageDraw> = ImageDraw.Draw(<Image>)
<ImageDraw>.point((x, y))                        # Truncates floats into ints.
<ImageDraw>.line((x1, y1, x2, y2 [, ...]))       # To get anti-aliasing use Image's resize().
<ImageDraw>.arc((x1, y1, x2, y2), deg1, deg2)    # Always draws in clockwise direction.
<ImageDraw>.rectangle((x1, y1, x2, y2))          # To rotate use Image's rotate() and paste().
<ImageDraw>.polygon((x1, y1, x2, y2, ...))       # Last point gets connected to the first.
<ImageDraw>.ellipse((x1, y1, x2, y2))            # To rotate use Image's rotate() and paste().
Use 'fill=<color>' to set the primary color.
Use 'width=<int>' to set the width of lines or contours.
Use 'outline=<color>' to set the color of the contours.
Color can be an int, tuple, '#rrggbb[aa]' string or a color name.

<Wave_write> = wave.open('<path>', 'wb')        # Truncates existing file.
<Wave_write>.setframerate(<int>)                # 44100 for CD, 48000 for video.
<Wave_write>.setnchannels(<int>)                # 1 for mono, 2 for stereo.
<Wave_write>.setsampwidth(<int>)                # 2 for CD quality sound.
<Wave_write>.setparams(<params>)                # Sets all parameters.
<Wave_write>.writeframes(<bytes>)               # Appends frames to the file.
Bytes object contains a sequence of frames, each consisting of one or more samples.
In a stereo signal, the first sample of a frame belongs to the left channel.
Each sample consists of one or more bytes that, when converted to an integer, indicate the displacement of a speaker membrane at a given moment.
If sample width is one byte, then the integer should be encoded unsigned.
For all other sizes, the integer should be encoded signed with little-endian byte order.

1208969691,"1. Write a function contracting(l) that takes as input a list of integer l and returns True if the absolute difference between each adjacent pair of elements strictly decreases.

Here are some examples of how your function should work.

  >>> contracting([9,2,7,3,1])
  True

  >>> contracting([-2,3,7,2,-1]) 
  False

  >>> contracting([10,7,4,1])
  False
  
2. In a list of integers l, the neighbours of l[i] are l[i-1] and l[i+1]. l[i] is a hill if it is strictly greater than its neighbours and a valley if it is strictly less than its neighbours.
Write a function counthv(l) that takes as input a list of integers l and returns a list [hc,vc] where hc is the number of hills in l and vc is the number of valleys in l.

Here are some examples to show how your function should work.

 
>>> counthv([1,2,1,2,3,2,1])
[2, 1]

>>> counthv([1,2,3,1])
[1, 0]

>>> counthv([3,1,2,3])
[0, 1]

3. A square n×n matrix of integers can be written in Python as a list with n elements, where each element is in turn a list of n integers, representing a row of the matrix. For instance, the matrix

  1  2  3
  4  5  6
  7  8  9
would be represented as [[1,2,3], [4,5,6], [7,8,9]].

Write a function leftrotate(m) that takes a list representation m of a square matrix as input, and returns the matrix obtained by rotating the original matrix counterclockwize by 90 degrees. For instance, if we rotate the matrix above, we get

  3  6  9
  2  5  8    
  1  4  7
Your function should not modify the argument m provided to the function rotate().

Here are some examples of how your function should work.

 
  >>> leftrotate([[1,2],[3,4]])
  [[2, 4], [1, 3]]

  >>> leftrotate([[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]])
  [[3, 6, 9], [2, 5, 8], [1, 4, 7]]

  >>> leftrotate([[1,1,1],[2,2,2],[3,3,3]])

1172980778,"Hi everyone! So I was searching for a good-first-issue to start contributing to the open source community, and since I have a PhD in Theoretical Computer Science, The Algorithms looks like the best place for me (python is also my favorite programming language :wink: ).

So I was reading all these comments here and did some digging in the source code and I have the following.

1. For the algorithm in [data_structures/hashing/number_theory/prime_numbers.py](https://github.com/TheAlgorithms/Python/blob/master/data_structures/hashing/number_theory/prime_numbers.py) I think we could **refactor** it to `is_prime` and change the algorithm to be `O(sqrt(n))`.
2. The functions in [prime_check.py](https://github.com/TheAlgorithms/Python/blob/master/maths/prime_check.py) and [primelib.py](https://github.com/TheAlgorithms/Python/blob/master/maths/primelib.py) are **not** defined as `is_prime` should we change those too?
3. Finally, I stumbled upon a duplicate of Eratosthenes' sieve in [sieve_of_eratosthenes.py](https://github.com/TheAlgorithms/Python/blob/master/maths/sieve_of_eratosthenes.py) and [prime_sieve_eratosthenes.py](https://github.com/TheAlgorithms/Python/blob/master/maths/prime_sieve_eratosthenes.py) should these two get merged? Is this a matter of another issue? I did some search in issues but did not find anything related.

I could do all these changes if no one else has done anything.

Cheers to all of ya! :beers: ",hi everyone searching start open source community since theoretical computer science like best place python also favorite language wink reading digging source code following algorithm think could change algorithm defined change finally upon duplicate sieve two get matter another issue search find anything related could one else done anything ya,issue,positive,positive,positive,positive,positive,positive

These are the occurrences of repeated isprime() like functions found on main libraries of the whole project:

maths.primelib.isPrime()
Function to determine if a number is prime or not. This function is just used on his own library of functions to handle prime numbers and his logic is different of maths.prime_check.prime_check(). prime_check() deals with negative numbers and floating point exceptions as opposed to isPrime() and, thus, i think it must be preferred.

Perhaps we can change those `isPrime` to `is_prime` (as a first step). It would be easier if we want to unify them in the future.

@poyea,

These are the occurrencies of repeated` isprime()` like functions found on main libraries of whole project:

`maths.primelib.isPrime()`	
Function to determine if a number is prime or not. This function is just used on his own library of functions to handle with prime numbers and his logic is different of `maths.prime_check.prime_check()`.` prime_check()` deals with negative numbers and float point exceptions as opposed to `isPrime()` and, thus, i think it must be preferred.

`ciphers.rabin_miller.isPrime()`	
Function to determine if a small number is prime or not. Same case as before: it's just used on his own library of functions to handle with prime numbers and dont treat float point exceptions. Renamed to` low_num_is_prime()`.

961755130,"> These are big changes and changing the test answers at the same time as changing the code worries me. @fernandobperezm can you please review the proposed changes?

Changing the test answers shouldn't worry you. I changed answers for 3 tests:
1 and 2:
```
>>> get_squarefree({1}, [])
set()
>>> get_squarefree({1, 2}, [])
set()
```
I don't understand why the answers are empty sets due to:
```
if len(squared_primes) == 0:
        return set()
```
In my opinion, when we don't provide any primes then we should assume that all numbers are squarefree instead of non-squarefree. But anyway I changed the interface of this function and now it gets only numbers without primes. So, obviously 1 and 2 are squarefree numbers, so I added correct answers.
3:
```
>>> solution(1)
    0
```
The first row of Pascal's triangle contains only one number 1 and it is squarefree number, so the answer should be 1 instead of 0.",big test time code please review test worry set set understand empty due return set opinion provide assume instead anyway interface function without obviously added correct solution first row triangle one number number answer instead,issue,negative,positive,neutral,neutral,positive,positive

The reason this is passing is that we're running mypy in the loosest of settings right now. To increase the actual coverage of type annotations (and get the most benefit), we should use the `--strict` flag. That's *really* strict though, so perhaps we can go with `--disallow-untyped-defs --check-untyped-defs --disallow-untyped-decorators --strict-equality` to begin with and work our way up.

On current `master`, I get the following results:
- `mypy --disallow-untyped-defs --check-untyped-defs --disallow-untyped-decorators --strict-equality .`
  - `Found 529 errors in 139 files (checked 649 source files)`
- `mypy --strict .`
  - `Found 1165 errors in 201 files (checked 649 source files)`

Both of these are without all of the ignored directories from `mypy.ini`. Removing that exclude list leads to
- `mypy --disallow-untyped-defs --check-untyped-defs --disallow-untyped-decorators --strict-equality .`
  - `Found 1572 errors in 321 files (checked 950 source files)`
- `mypy --strict .`
  - `Found 3026 errors in 412 files (checked 950 source files)`

tl;dr: there's still lots of room for improvement here :)

We always run on the latest Python version so we will adopt the built in generic types instead of importing it from the `typing` module.

Indeed when you run command `mypy --ignore-missing-imports .` it just shows those kind of errors. However, I do see some files that do not have type annotations and are not shown by that.

for example
https://github.com/TheAlgorithms/Python/blob/729b4d875a07bd15bc6e5e8a3c79f16fa1e003e6/graphs/a_star.py

@PouriaBakrani
What do you mean by _""keep all of the last codes of before guesses_""? Is it something like displaying all the incorrect guesses along with the final one at the end of the program? If so I'd use a list to store them and print at the end, although  - I just don't really understand this.

And if you mean the computer keeps getting one same answer - I see that you are trying to use two variables (the original _guess_ and the new _hads_) in case the computer doesn't store the new guess number. I personally think it's a good idea, but if you use this, you'll still have to transfer the new guess stored in _hads_ to the _guess_ which still contains the old guess, in order for this to work.
And there's also other issues... below is an altered version of your code (yes I didn't write it my own way, just so you could see the alternation more clearly):

hope this helps!

Personally, I like the one-function approach. A second function that performs almost the same task seems redundant. There could just be one function which always returns a list. That way, the user can check the length by themselves. This also means that the function could return an empty list if the input list is empty.

Since it's in the directory `fractals`, you could add one example that looks a little more ""fractal-like"", for example, something from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julia_set#Quadratic_polynomials.

Modules can opt-in to the typing ecosystem via two key mechanisms:

Add type hints or stubs to their code, and include a file named py.typed within the package they distribute to PyPi (or any other package repository). The presence of this marker makes the package PEP-561-aware. The mypy docs also have more info about PEP-561-aware packages.

@lawric1 Hello! I'm a bot made to check all the pull request Python files. First of all, I want to say thank you for your time and interest in this project and for opening a pull request.

I have detected errors in some of the Python files submitted in this pull request. Please read through the report and make the necessary changes. You can take a look at the relevant links provided after the report.

### What are node paths?
The report contain headings and a checklist where the items are paths to the class/function/parameter where the error is present. Node paths are double colon `::` separated names and can be any of the following format:
- Class path: `[file_name]::[class_name]`
- Function path: `[file_name]::[function_name]`
- Function parameter path: `[file_name]::[function_name]::[parameter_name]`
- Method path: `[file_name]::[class_name]::[function_name]`
- Method parameter path: `[file_name]::[class_name]::[function_name]::[parameter_name]`

### Following functions require tests [`doctest`/`unittest`/`pytest`]:

732875905,Running on Python 3.9 is different than having a wheel for Python 3.9.  The former means that it does not work.  The latter means that it works but the install time is long.  The tests for all of our quantum algorithms run and pass on Python 3.9.  The long install times are dealt with by your pip cache.,running python different wheel python former work latter work install time long quantum run pas python long install time dealt pip cache,issue,negative,negative,neutral,neutral,negative,negative
